1
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:27,083
<i>The ancient Greeks
believed humans once had four arms,</i>

2
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,875
<i>four legs, and a single head
made of two faces.</i>

3
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>We were happy.</i>

4
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,791
<i>Complete.</i>

5
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,208
<i>So complete that the gods,</i>

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:40,083
<i>fearing our wholeness would quell
our need for worship, cleaved us in two...</i>

7
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,833
<i>leaving our split selves
to wander the Earth in misery.</i>

8
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,916
<i>Forever longing.</i>

9
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:55,166
<i>Longing.</i>

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,291
<i>Longing...</i>

11
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,541
<i>for the other half of our soul.</i>

12
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,958
<i>It is said that when one half
finds its other...</i>

13
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,208
<i>there's an unspoken understanding.</i>

14
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:28,458
<i>A unity.</i>

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>And each would know no greater joy...</i>

16
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:33,916
<i>than this.</i>

17
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,458
<i>Of course...</i>

18
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,791
<i>the ancient Greeks
never went to high school.</i>

19
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:44,625
Good hang out.

20
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:45,583
Whatever.

21
00:01:45,666 --> 00:01:46,958
<i>Or they'd realize...</i>

22
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,833
Crap.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,940
<i>...we don't need the gods
to mess things up for us.</i>

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,708
<i>If you ask me...</i>

25
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:14,541
<i>people spend far too much time
looking for someone to complete them.</i>

26
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,500
<i>How many people find perfect love?</i>

27
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,541
<i>Or if they do...</i>

28
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:23,333
<i>make it last?</i>

29
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,916
<i>More evidence of Camus' theory
that life is irrational...</i>

30
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,791
<i>and meaningless.</i>

31
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:40,625
<i>And that, my friends, is some
A-plus love philosophy right there.</i>

32
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,416
<i>Or A-minus if Mrs. G is in a bad mood.</i>

33
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,125
<i>Either way, it's an A or you don't pay.</i>

34
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:23,375
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the immoral persons.

35
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,458
And everyone who loves
and practices lying...

36
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:34,000
Ellie Chu!

37
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,958
Chugga chugga Chu Chu!

38
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,750
Fantastic.
The angels weep with joy.

39
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,833
Next up...

40
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,750
the winter talent show.

41
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,791
Mandatory for all seniors.

42
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:03,333
This is your last chance
to strut your stuff. Mandatory.

43
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:07,791
Once again, the wall tubas
must be checked out before use.

44
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,916
These are very delicate instruments
with sticky valves.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,041
Some bad news.

46
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:17,000
Someone left their Dr. Pepper
in our storage cupboard.

47
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,875
Imagine a world without flutes...

48
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,726
- Did you mute me, Bruce?
- No, Kaitlin, I didn't.

49
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,416
I can tell
if you mute me, Bruce. I can tell.

50
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,583
Jerry's parents are in Spokane...

51
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,426
I'll bring the Xbox.

52
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,166
...please bring it back.

53
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,958
No questions asked.

54
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,291
Is there a problem?

55
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,958
No, Mr. Flores.

56
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,833
Next up, we had an issue...

57
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,875
I heard his sister
went to Seattle with the church.

58
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,083
She's majoring in sociology.

59
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,791
Hey. Send this down to the big guy.

60
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:12,583
- I think I'm going deaf.
- Oh, thank you very much.

61
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,250
No, but honestly, man,
the man I want to be when I'm older

62
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,541
is not the man I am today,
you know what I'm saying?

63
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:19,500
Aster!

64
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:22,916
- So, you've just gotta keep living, man.
- Always has her head in a book.

65
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,142
- You've just gotta keep living life.
- Choir, stand up.

66
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,125
Let's all turn to page 49.

00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:40,125

<i>...this is not a love story.</i>

74
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,666
Are you men or are you losers?

75
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,142
- Come on, ladies, let's go!
- Coming through!

76
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,291
<i>Or not one

81
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,666
We are the source of our own hell.

82
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:50,458
Five hundred words on Sartre's use
of thwarted desire, Monday.

83
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,708
- Six different takes on Plato. Impressive.
- Just the one.

84
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,708
That's what I tell the bartender.

85
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,450
How come you never turn me in?

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,666
And have to read
the actual essays they'd write?

87
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,500
- You know I'm going to E-dub.
- Damn shame.

88
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:11,833
Damn full ride.

89
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,666
I can live at home and, plus,
I get to stay in lovely Squahamish.

90
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,250
- Hell-quahamish.
- It's not that bad.

91
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,708
Okay, it's not that good either,
but it's what's happening.

92
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,333
I spent four of the best years of my life
at Grinnell.

93
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,500
And look at you,
back home in Hell-quahamish.

94
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,916
You're right.
Stay away from the liberal arts.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,458
- Try not to get fired over the weekend.
- Are you kidding?

96
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,541
Everyone in this town fears God,
but you know who God fears?

97
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,291
The Teachers Union.

98
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,916
Chugga chugga Chu Chu.

99
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,750
Hey!

100
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,625
Hey.

101
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,250
Hey!

102
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:52,666
Hey!

103
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:54,666
Hold up!

104
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,333
Whoa!

105
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,333
What is wrong with you?

106
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,333
I'm sorry. I, uh...

107
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,583
Uh...

108
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,791
Ten dollars for three pages,
$20 for three to ten.

109
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,035
Not in the over-ten-page biz.

110
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,500
No, I'm not trying to cheat.

111
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:17,666
Nobody is. Whose class is it for?

112
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,833
No, it... it's not... Um...

113
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,375
- What's this?
- A letter.

114
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,833
- Who writes letters these days?
- I... I thought it'd seem romantic.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,416
- Can't help you.
- I... I just need a few words. Good ones.

116
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,083
I'm not writing to Aster Fl...

117
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:36,625
To some girl.

118
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,642
It'd be wrong. A letter is personal.
It's supposed to be authentic.

119
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,416
- That'd be awesome.
- No! I can't be you being authen...

120
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:46,125
Get a thesaurus, use spell-check.
Good luck, Romeo.

121
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,583
No, I can pay more for authentic.

122
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,250
Did you call the power company?

123
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,083
They don't understand my accent.

124
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,041
Did you try?

125
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:11,875
Shh.

126
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,625
Best part.

127
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:18,250
"I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

128
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,791
I'll call tomorrow.

129
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,125
<i>Inland Power And Light.</i>

130
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm calling for account 460A38.

131
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,666
<i>Please hold.</i>

132
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,101
<i>Please re-enter your selection.</i>

133
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
Bill. Extension.

134
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,375
<i>Please hold.</i>

135
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,041
These hallways are murder.

136
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,125
I'm Ellie Chu.

137
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,708
Yes, I know.

138
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,458
You've only been playing my dad's services
every Sunday for, like, four years.

139
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,500
You're his favorite heathen.
He can't handle mediocre accompanists.

140
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,208
Even if they are saved.

141
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,000
<i>Remains Of The Day.</i>

142
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:40,958
Loved it.

143
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,000
All that barely repressed longing.

144
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,791
"I'm Ellie Chu"?

145
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,416
<i>Yes, I know. Your bill
is three months overdue, Mrs. Chu.</i>

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,583
<i>If we don't get a minimum payment of $50,
your power will terminate tomorrow.</i>

147
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,041
Fifty dollars, one letter.
After that, you're on your own.

148
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,125
Yes!

149
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,541
<i>"Dear Aster Flores: I think you're really beautiful.</i>

150
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,458
<i>Even if you were ugly,
I'd want to know you,</i>

151
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,625
<i>because you are smart and nice, too."</i>

152
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,208
"It's hard to find
all those things in one girl.

153
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,333
But even if you were only
two of those things, I'd be into it.

154
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,833
But you're, like, all three,
just to be clear."

155
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,791
She's like all three.

156
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,000
Thanks for clarifying.

157
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,125
"About me.

158
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,750
Some people think
I'm the cutest one in my family.

159
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,708
Those people being my grandma...

160
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:57,500
who's dead now.

161
00:11:58,166 --> 00:11:59,958
Never mind about my dead grandma.

162
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,208
All I'm saying is that I like fries.
I like dipping them in my milkshake.

163
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,291
Is that weird?

164
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,083
It's actually really tasty.

165
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,886
Would you like to try that
with me sometime?

166
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,500
I work part-time and I have a truck.
Let me know whenever.

167
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,583
Thanks.

168
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,583
Paul Munsky, second string tight end...

169
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:18,166
football."

170
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:23,500
- So what you're trying to say is...
- I'm in love with her.

171
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,208
Have you ever spoken to her?

172
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,125
I'm not good with words.

173
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,166
But you know you love her?

174
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,625
I know I think about her when I wake up.

175
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,000

00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,375
Hey!

351
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:05,916
Hey!

352
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,458
<i>"Or not."</i>

353
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,666
<i>"Everything beautiful
is ruined eventually.</i>

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,250
<i>Maybe that's the thing.</i>

355
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,416
<i>If you do ruin your painting...</i>

356
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,625
<i>you gotta know
you have everything in you</i>

357
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,833
<i>to get to that
pretty good painting again."</i>

358
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,375
<i>"But if you never
do the bold stroke..."</i>

359
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:40,208
<i>"You'll never know
if you could've had a great painting."</i>

360
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:42,291
...triangle is different.

361
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,958
All polygons with three sides.

362
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:46,916
Take one side away,

363
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,833
now it's just an angle.

364
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,416
Add a side, that's a square.

365
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,125
<i>When does the dating start?</i>

366
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,500
This is dating.

367
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,791
No, dating is burgers
and fries and shakes.

368
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:00,208
And maybe another order of fries.

369
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:01,791
And...

370
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,291
- I'm gonna text her.
- Wait, what?

371
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,934
- At a certain point, you've gotta close.
- We're not at that point!

372
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,083
We're way past that point.

373
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,875
Oh, my God.

374
00:24:29,416 --> 00:24:31,041
I've gone...

375
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,833
"Little sister hacked my phone.

376
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:35,250
Can we take this to a safer platform?

377
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,625
Ghost Messenger?

378
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:37,708
My handle's...

379
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,083
Smith Corona."

380
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,958
- Who's Smith Corona?
- Just a guy.

381
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:46,500
Crap.

382
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,583
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

383
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,500
I'm the king of the mud!
Babe! Babe, did you get that?

384
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,541
Caption it, "Mudding king."

385
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:01,750
Mudding king! Mudding king!

386
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,375
Mudding king! Mudding...

387
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,208
<i>New ghost message.</i>

388
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,333
- Yeah, we did it!
- Yes!

389
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,416
<i>She prefers abstract to representational.</i>

390
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,940
<i>If she brings up </i>Remains Of The Day,

391
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,892
<i>talk about how the movie loses out
by not spending more time on the Nazis.</i>

392
00:25:36,916 --> 00:25:38,583
Relax. I got this.

393
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,583
- <i>But...</i>
- It's a date, not a book report.

394
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,958
I got two of them signed when he came
to Powell's Books last year.

395
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,375
I drove all night to get there.

396
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,083
Oh, uh...

397
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:52,958
Cool.

398
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:55,250
You've probably already read it.

399
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,791
- Thought you'd like one.
- Uh, yeah, totally.

400
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,416
No, I... I love, uh...

401
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,291
Nazis.

402
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:06,476
<i>I mean, the... the ones in the book.</i>

403
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,750
<i>I mean, like, more of those Nazis.
Am I right?</i>

404
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,708
Uh, speaking of Nazis...

405
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,625
thank you for meeting me here.

406
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,500
My dad...

407
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,000
he isn't a Nazi exactly, but, uh...

408
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,875
he can be pretty strict.

409
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,708
You know, people talk.

410
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,666
Um, yeah. Talk. Ugh.

411
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,416
It's nice...

412
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,458
to make a new friend, though.

413
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,416
Oh.

414
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,458
A friend.

415
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,583
Good.

416
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,583
They use Reddi-wip.

417
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,458
Oh.

418
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,958
It's, uh... from a can.

419
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,416
Uh... but it's okay.

420
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,875
<i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

421
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,000
What about that date wasn't bad?
You have nothing in common.

422
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,000
Not yet, but...

423
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,166
Game over.

424
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,541
I can't give up.

425
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,041
Look, you and Aster Flores,
not gonna happen.

426
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:40,250
- Chugga chugga Chu Chu!
- Hey!

427
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,470
- Who are you calling "Chu Chu"?
- Shit, let's get out of here!

428
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,916
What kind of wusses say dumb shit
and then drive away?

429
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,500
Yeah, you'd better run!

430
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,291
What?

431
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,000
Aster Flores thinks
you're into abstract art

432
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,708
and repressed British literature.

433
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,375
- Yeah.
- None of that is you.

434
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,416
It could be. I started reading
that <i>Remains Of The Day </i>book.

435
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,041
- Really?
- Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,

436
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,541
but I'm still reading it.

437
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,291
That's gotta count for something.

438
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,375
There are no points for effort.

439
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:20,083
Isn't that what love is? How much effort
you put into loving someone?

440
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,083
Well, whatever love is,

441
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,246
we just blew it with Aster Flores.

442
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:37,791
Yes!

443
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,166
No, I can do this.

444
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,333
We can do this.

445
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
Okay.

446
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,583
I'll pay you double.

447
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,208
You don't have to pay me.

448
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,666
Don't be weird, dude.
Why else would you do this?

449
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,458
No, I've got savings.

450
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,333
Next date is three weeks away.

451
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,059
- Three weeks?
- You told her you're slammed

452
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,916
- with football training.
- I... I did?

453
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,267
Yes. Also, you're in a debate
on who's the better Hepburn.

454
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,291
Who there?

455
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
Ba, did we wake you?

456
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,875
School project.

457
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,666
Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.

458
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,184
We don't have time to school you
on everything Aster thinks you are,

459
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,625
so we have to be selective.
Deep versus broad-based learning.

460
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,083
- Huh?
<i>- </i>We spy on her,

461
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,750
then cram you on her greatest hits.

462
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh, cool.

463
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,833
- Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

464
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,083
Are you ready for this?

465
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,083
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

466
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,000
Shh!

467
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,416
So, in <i>No Exit,</i>
three people are trapped in hell.

468
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,041
A door opens, but nobody leaves.

469
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,083
That's nuts. He can't stand these people.

470
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,750
A door opens and he doesn't leave?

471
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,184
He's trapped in hell.
It's a metaphor for existence.

472
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,041
My nana hated Minnesota. She left.

473
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,767
Your nana wasn't one of
the great thinkers of the 20th century.

474
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,333
Nana's not trapped in hell either.

475
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,625
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

476
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,333
The hell's got into Munsky?

477
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:09,750
<i>You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.</i>

478
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,791
<i>You're so cool and fine.</i>

479
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,875
<i>I don't want to be worshiped,
I want to be loved.</i>

480
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,666
Key thing about <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
is it's a plea for tolerance.

481
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,270
Check this out. I'm calling it
taco sausage. Do you want a bite?

482
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,916
No. So tolerance...

483
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,291
Two hand foods, one great taste.

484
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,916
Conversation is like ping-pong.

485
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,666
I hit one and then you...

486
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What the...

487
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,625
Oops.

488
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,958
We're writing a profile
on the student we most admire.

489
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,500
Oh, cool, cool.

490
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,103
- Views on women in the workplace?
- Does Aster like lean meats?

491
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,583
What are you doing?

492
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,791
- I'm good cop.
- Then how come you aren't smiling?

493
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,041
I'll smile when you follow the plan
that I carefully...

494
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,208
I'm surprised more kids
haven't asked to interview me. Huh.

495
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,916
I'm going in.
I'm going in with my smile.

496
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,833
<i>Looks like The Moose have a man open.</i>

497
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>Oh!</i>

498
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,583
You're not hungry?

499
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,916
Not if it's not time to eat.

500
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,208
Now that's weird.

501
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,958
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

502
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,541
I don't want to try a taco sausage.

503
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,375
Why Squahamish?

504
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:35,083
Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy.

505
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,583
- I gotta go.
- No, no, no, wait.

506
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,833
No, you're not taking this seriously.
I have a ton of work I have to do.

507
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
No, just, you're so smart.
Like, too smart to, like...

508
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,976
Waste my time trying to win you a girl
who'll never look your way?

509
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,666
- No, it just seems weird.
- You're weird!

510
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
No... Yes.

511
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,750
- Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish.
- No, no...

512
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,083
The thing about <i>No Exit </i>is it's like how
what I really want is to run my own shop,

513
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,916
with new recipes. And... And FYI,
taco sausage is really effing good.

514
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,458
Okay, but I'm the fourth son

515
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,833
and my family's been making
the same sausage for 49 years

516
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,356
and it doesn't matter
if they're going broke, or out of style,

517
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,333
they're Nana's recipes.

518
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,684
If Ma can't have Nana,
at least she can make her sausages.

519
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,628
If I break away, it'll break her heart.
And it's either her heart or mine.

520
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,416
So I stay.

521
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,208
We had to go
where my dad could get a job.

522
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,500
He studied trains?

523
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,083
Engineering.

524
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,333
PhD, no less.

525
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,041
So, uh,

526
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,625
he became the station manager
at Squahamish.

527
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,708
To start.

528
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,250
The plan was to be promoted
to system engineer.

529
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,541
Or anything engineer.

530
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,166
Squahamish was a jumping-off point.

531
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,000
It turns out speaking good English
trumps having a PhD.

532
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,583
Or one from China anyway.

533
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,875
And my dad, he...

534
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,291
Doesn't speak very good.

535
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,666
- He's not bad.
- I don't speak very good either.

536
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,875
True.

537
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,708
What's your excuse?

538
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,375
How do you feel about pot roast?

539
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,791
I should get back to the station.

540
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,458
I know, but we've gotta eat.

541
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,684
<i>Mom!</i>

542
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,375
Tommy, stop friending my friends!

543
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:51,000
Would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal?

544
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,916
I'll deal with the dog wrestling.

545
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,708
- Mom!
- It's your fault!

546
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,458
Or we could go to your place?

547
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:30,083
Match energy, match strokes,
and just say one thing.

548
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,625
Where were you born?

549
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:35,958
In Squahamish.

550
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,166
What about you?

551
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,375
Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.

552
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,416
But where were you born?

553
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,708
I don't need talking practice.

554
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,083
It just seems
like a really short conversation.

555
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:58,583
I was born in Xuzhou, China.

556
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:01,375
When did you come here?

557
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,291
When I was five.

558
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,875
- What do you like about Squahamish?
- Uh...

559
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,083
I've never been anywhere else.

560
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,250
Me neither.

561
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,333
<i>How does Satan get his message through?</i>

562
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:23,541
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the immoral persons.

563
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,958
Does he write letters?

564
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,500
No, he causes us to question.

565
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,083
Question our lives, our path.

566
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,083
Our very faith in God.

567
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,708
Satan plants the seed of doubt...

568
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,708
...and, from that seed, grows sin.

569
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:48,625
Sin is everywhere.

570
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,291
We're lucky to live in a good town
like Squahamish.

571
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:57,083
But the world is changing.

572
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,208
Let us stay strong against Satan's call,

573
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:05,333
lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life God has prepared for us.

574
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,666
You know what it's like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you?

575
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,458
You know where else you can meet
people your age who get you?

576
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,541
College.

577
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,483
<i>You should send some emojis.</i>

578
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,541
I'm not sending her emojis.

579
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:28,125
Do pineapple, owl,
caterpillar with glasses.

580
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,000
What does that mean?

581
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,458
That doesn't mean anything.

582
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,381
Glasses make the caterpillar look smart.

583
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,125
Favorite food?

584
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,250
Braised pork over rice. Yours?

585
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:38,791
Taco sausage.

586
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,708
- Does braised pork have five-spice powder?
- How do you know five-spice powder?

587
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,166
I kind of creeped in your cabinets.

588
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,958
I'm always looking for new spices.

589
00:37:47,708 --> 00:37:48,958
Giving up on the taco sausage?

590
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:51,958
Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper
in Wenatchee for months now.

591
00:37:52,041 --> 00:37:53,666
If I could just get the guy to taste it.

592
00:37:54,125 --> 00:37:56,416
- The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee.
- Yeah.

593
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:58,625
Hey, you gotta try it.

594
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:00,708
What do the other Munskys think?

595
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,916
They haven't tried it.

596
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,125
Taco sausage has a nice ring to it.

597
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,333
Yeah, right?

598
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:16,708
Hey.

599
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:17,791
Yeah?

600
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,083
What was your mom like?

601
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:23,958
Young, funny, dead.

602
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
No, before she died.

603
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,458
Young, funny...

604
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,875
fun.

605
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,125
She sounds cool.

606
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Yeah.

607
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,666
I bet she would've tried
the taco sausage.

608
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,250
What do you like about Aster?

609
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,291
She's pretty...

610
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,208
and...

611
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
smart...

612
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,750
and she's never mean.

613
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,208
And she smells like fresh-ground flour.

614
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,666
Why?

615
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,625
Just wondering.

616
00:39:56,541 --> 00:39:58,041
What else could I like about her?

617
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,125
I don't know.

618
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,250
How her eyes look right into yours.

619
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:09,541
How...

620
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,708
she twirls her hair when she's reading.

621
00:40:14,791 --> 00:40:15,791
How...

622
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,333
her laugh...

623
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:22,625
busts out like she can't help herself
and she stops being so perfect

624
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,250
for just a few moments.

625
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:27,916
She has at least five different voices.

626
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:33,125
How you could live
in an ocean of her thoughts and...

627
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,875
feel like she knows,

628
00:40:34,958 --> 00:40:36,166
like really knows...

629
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,791
I'm so stupid.

630
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,708
- I just meant...
- No, I'm so dumb.

631
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,267
- No...
- Like a real idiot.

632
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,976
- Don't think that I...
- No, what you said.

633
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,642
That's what you say when you love someone.

634
00:40:50,666 --> 00:40:52,041
No, I... I was just talking.

635
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,000
- I would never, ever actually...
- No, it is.

636
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,250
And... And you don't even care.

637
00:40:56,333 --> 00:40:58,791
I mean, I love her and I can't even...

638
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,083
Agh!

639
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:17,958
You try...

640
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,291
harder than...

641
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,916
anyone I've ever met...

642
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:28,583
I mean, with the possible exception
of my dad with my mom...

643
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:32,166
to show a girl that...

644
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,083
you love them.

645
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:41,083
And if love isn't the effort you put in...

646
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:44,666
then...

647
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:47,791
what is it?

648
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:52,916
Yeah?

649
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,750
Yeah.

650
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:47,125
I can't believe you drink Yakult.

651
00:42:47,208 --> 00:42:48,458
Stadium vending machine.

652
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,750
Coach is gonna provide it free.
Keeps him regular.

653
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:51,833
Seriously?

654
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:54,166
The only Asian grocery
is three hours by bike.

655
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,416
Do not run after her train.

656
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Do not.

657
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:02,916
Do not! Ugh.

658
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,916
- It's kinda sweet.
- Kinda trite.

659
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,791
Uh, it shows that he cares.

660
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,166
It shows he's a moron.

661
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:10,625
Who outruns trains?

662
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:14,083
That girl's thinking, "Thank God I got out
before wasting my life on that idiot."

663
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,000
She looks sad.

664
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,833

00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:40,958
Oh.

705
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:42,791
Okay.

706
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,541
What were you about to say?

707
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,250
Oh, uh...

708
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,000
It's still cool that we're...

709
00:46:58,875 --> 00:46:59,875
friends.

710
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:04,750
Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.

711
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:06,833
Friends.

712
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:29,791
You messaged me?

713
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,041
Uh, yeah.

714
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,791
You're not just a girl.

715
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,583
I think you are...

716
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,208
You are...

717
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:58,875
No.

718
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,559
<i>I don't want to be just friends.</i>

719
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:11,583
Wait, what?

720
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,375
No, no. Bad. Sit!

721
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,541
Uh...

722
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:17,458
Oh.

723
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:20,958
I think you're pretty and funny

724
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,666
and smart and your laughter, it's like...

725
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:25,416
an ocean of thoughts.

726
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,875
Like five oceans of thoughts. Like five...

727
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,416
voice...

728
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,666
I like you.

729
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,291
I don't... I don't know what to say.

730
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:41,083
Yeah, me neither.

731
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:44,416
I'm not a good talker.

732
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,250
That's okay.

733
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,000
Okay.

741
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:45,666
Number 86, Paul Munsky!

742
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,833
And now, his side-girl's gonna rock
the senior recital.

743
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:50,583
It's a piano solo.

744
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,041
- You're gonna be awesome.
- I'm gonna be puking.

745
00:51:53,125 --> 00:51:54,750
You're always playing for an audience.

746
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:55,833
On the side.

747
00:51:56,333 --> 00:51:58,125
Not on stage, alone.

748
00:51:58,208 --> 00:52:00,250
- You're gonna crush it.
- Hmm.

749
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:04,416
Oh, did I tell you that some food guy
from the paper in Tukwila wrote me?

750
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,708
He must have heard about me
from the guy in Wenatchee.

751
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,125
He likes how my sausage sounds
and he wants to try it.

752
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:10,916
Boom! It... It's Munsky time.

753
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,916
Hey, look at you.

754
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:28,625
So...

755
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,291
what did you and Aster talk about?

756
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,083
Uh, I don't know.

757
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:39,500
You know, we got milkshakes and fries.

758
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:42,916
And we held hands.

759
00:52:44,916 --> 00:52:46,833
It was, uh, quiet...

760
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:48,875
and...

761
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:51,416
nice.

762
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:56,583
And then she had curfew,
so we walked back to her car and...

763
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,791
I kissed her.

764
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
How...

765
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:03,833
does that...

766
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,750
happen?

767
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,250
What?

768
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:08,916
The kiss.

769
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,541
I kissed her.

770
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,458
How do you know she wants to be kissed?

771
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,333
Oh...

772
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:20,750
She gives you a look.

773
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:22,416
A look?

774
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,750
Yeah, like, um...

775
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:31,083
Um...

776
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:39,375
Okay, she gives you a look and,
when you see the look, you make your move.

777
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,916
Otherwise you look like a real putz.

778
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:43,583
- Hmm.
- And now we've got, like, a <i>date </i>date,

779
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:46,786
not just a friend date, when she gets back
from some youth group in Sacramento.

780
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,066
There are dressing rooms, you know.

781
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:55,000
- I'll just get this.
- Really?

782
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,625
- Yeah.
- No, it's just...

783
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:01,958
You know, without the jeans
and the flannel shirt...

784
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,250
you look weird.

785
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:05,958
Gee, thanks.

786
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:07,541
It just doesn't look like you.

787
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:08,875
Uh, all girled up.

788
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:10,625
I know.

789
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,041
Go to the dressing room.
I'll toss you some things.

790
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,166
But you're a dude.

791
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,250
I have a sister.

792
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,250
Go.

793
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:43,500
Well, our next senior
needs no introduction.

794
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:47,291
What up, Squahamish! Moose!

795
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,250

00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:53,916

798
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,958

Hey.

831
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,250
Hey!

832
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:36,958
- Come on.
- Senior recital after-party! Whoo!

833
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,416
The Chinese girl came!

834
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,291
- Chinese girl!
- Ellie Chu.

835
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,916
I just wanted to tell you
we've had math together all four years

836
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,960
and I always wanted to say
that I like your nails.

837
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Oh.

838
01:00:55,958 --> 01:00:57,666
Yeah. Can't get the bike grease out.

839
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,791
They look badass.

840
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:00,458
Do you want to play Drinkers of Catan?

841
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:04,291
Okay. So it's like Settlers,
but just, when you cross a fairway,

842
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,625
you take three shots
and you just keep going.

843
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:15,208
- Oh!
- That's a lot! That's a lot!

844
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,208
That's so much!

845
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,916
I will trade you wheat for rye.

846
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,333
Oh, bourbon it is.

847
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:25,625
Thanks.

848
01:01:27,916 --> 01:01:29,166
I want you to know...

849
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:32,833
that I can tell
I have been drinking spirits.

850
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:36,625
Because I have to pee far more often...

851
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,000
than would be indicated by plain punch.

852
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:44,166
So don't think
I haven't been monitoring the situation.

853
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,125
Cool, cool.
How many cups have you monitored?

854
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,708
Mmm...

855
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:49,791
Let's get you home.

856
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,250
Okay.

857
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,726
He's at practice,
but you can leave it in his room.

858
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:24,083
Yeah, it's just something silly
I thought he'd like.

859
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,958
We went as far as Sekiu once,

860
01:03:34,041 --> 01:03:36,333
but we never made it
all the way to California.

861
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:39,416
You're quite the little traveler.
I would love to go to California.

862
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,833
Oh, it's Paul's Chinese friend.

863
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,333
I didn't hear you come in.

864
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:46,083
I was just, um, dropping off some books.

865
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:49,291
Aster was just dropping off... Tommy!

866
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,083
Hands off the grinder!

867
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,125
Tommy!

868
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,750
Hi.

869
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,500
Hi.

870
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,416
So, uh, you... you and Paul, you guys...

871
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,458
Oh, God, no. No, no, no.
He is, like, totally, 100% into you.

872
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,375
Oh.

873
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,708
You know about us?

874
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,375
He wanted to do some extra reading so...

875
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,333
I lent him some books.

876
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:27,750
He's doing extra reading?

877
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:29,541
For you.

878
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:34,416
That's, uh...

879
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:36,208
That's sweet.

880
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:38,125
It is.

881
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:41,458
On our first date, uh...

882
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:43,041
I just kept...

883
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:45,416
talking about books.

884
01:04:46,541 --> 01:04:48,166
I think I almost drove him off.

885
01:04:49,458 --> 01:04:51,208
I can be such a nervous idiot.

886
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,541
You could never be an idiot.

887
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:55,833
I mean, Paul would never think that
about you, because he's way into you.

888
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,833
- I should get back to the station.
- No, yeah, no.

889
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,083
Oh, it's just some silly thing I made
on my trip.

890
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,916
I like this stroke off to the side.

891
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,500
Lonely,

892
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:17,541
but hopeful.

893
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:20,791
Yeah.

894
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:22,708
He'll love it.

895
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:25,916
Hey.

896
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,458
Can I come with?

897
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:32,500
To the station?

898
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:36,166
I already lied to my dad
about where I'd be.

899
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:38,541
I have the day.

900
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,000
You get to do that every day?

901
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:05,083
Twice. 6:40 a.m. and 11:40 p.m weekdays.
12:10 p.m. and 9:20 p.m weekends.

902
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,250
Give or take an hour.

903
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,916
That is awesome.

904
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:10,500
- It's a real blast.
- No, it's... it's so...

905
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,416
master of the universe.

906
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,958
A teeny-tiny universe.

907
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh, well. At least you rule something.

908
01:06:21,916 --> 01:06:23,041
Hey, what about those?

909
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,041
My dad doesn't trust them.

910
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:48,041

Right?

926
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:18,041
Are these deciduous trees?

927
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,416
I wouldn't know.

928
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:37,208
We don't have trees like this
in Sacramento.

929
01:08:38,791 --> 01:08:40,458
Everything's reversed, so...

930
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:43,791
things die off in summer,
turn green in winter.

931
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,750
Is that where you grew up?

932
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:48,791
Born there. Moved here.

933
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,000
My life story.

934
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,041
Is that long underwear?

935
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:15,791
Yes.

936
01:09:19,541 --> 01:09:20,541
I almost forgot.

937
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:25,083
There's no cell service here, so...

938
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:30,041
<i>And the Lord said, "Let..."</i>

939
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,458
It's like no one can reach us here.

940
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,625
Ellie not here.

941
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,375
Oh, this is for you.

942
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,750
Taylor Swift's yacht saves the day.

943
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,541
You know...

944
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:59,250
I don't think I've ever hung out with
a girl and not talked about boys before.

945
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,166
Oh.

946
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,416
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

947
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,166
It's nice.

948
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:11,583
Paul's cool.

949
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,125
He's confusing.

950
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,000
It's like when I'm with him...

951
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:21,666
I feel...

952
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I feel safe.

953
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:27,041
He's a sweet guy.

954
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,125
Then it's like he...

955
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:32,750
writes these things that feel...

956
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,458
not safe.

957
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,083
Not safe?

958
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,125
I overheard Trig
talking to my dad about...

959
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,166
our future wedding.

960
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,750
I mean,
he hasn't even asked me yet, but...

961
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,083
he's just...

962
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:57,833
so sure.

963
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,916
And maybe that's love.

964
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,083
I should marry Trig.

965
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:07,791
Oh.

966
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:09,541
Should I?

967
01:11:14,958 --> 01:11:15,958
Oh, well.

968
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:19,583
God doesn't know either,
if it's any consolation.

969
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:22,250
I don't believe in God.

970
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:26,083
That must be so nice.

971
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:28,458
No.

972
01:11:29,541 --> 01:11:30,541
It's not.

973
01:11:32,291 --> 01:11:33,291
It's...

974
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:36,875
lonely.

975
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:40,958
Yeah.

976
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,458
I wish I knew what I believed.

977
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,958
I keep asking God for a sign.

978
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,875
And then Paul's letter
appeared in my locker.

979
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,333
I've...

980
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,125
never felt so...

981
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:05,500
...understood.

982
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,375
It's...

983
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:13,625
It's silly, right?

984
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,333
No.

985
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,416
It's not silly.

986
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:24,708
You know what is silly?

987
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,625
What are you... No, stop!

988
01:12:31,708 --> 01:12:32,875
- Come on!
- No. I...

989
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,125
Did you layer?

990
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:36,083
I am a Russian doll of clothing.

991
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:03,666
Gravity is matter's response
to loneliness.

992
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,083
Who said that?

993
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:13,666
<i>♪ How could we let it slip away? ♪</i>

994
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I don't know.

995
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:20,958
<i>♪ We've come too far ♪</i>

996
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:24,833
- Then you said it.
<i>- ♪ To leave it all behind ♪</i>

997
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:32,041
<i>♪ How could we end it all this way? ♪</i>

998
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:37,333
<i>♪ When tomorrow comes
And we'll both regret... ♪</i>

999
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:39,250
My mom loved this song.

1000
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:43,166
She said every song, movie, story...

1001
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,416
has a best part.

1002
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:58,666
Was that it?

1003
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:02,083
Are you asking or saying?

1004
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,750
<i>♪ A love like ours ♪</i>

1005
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:15,291
<i>- ♪ Is love that's hard to find ♪</i>
- That was it.

1006
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:18,500
Yeah.

1007
01:14:18,583 --> 01:14:22,625

1008
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:33,875

1009
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,666
<i>♪ How could we end it all this way? ♪</i>

1010
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,750
Hey.

1011
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,416
I hope you find something good
to believe in.

1012
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,767
<i>- I'm getting married, Walter.
- You can't. You're a newspaper man.</i>

1013
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,591
<i>That's why I'm quitting. I want to go
someplace where I can be a woman.</i>

1014
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:11,208
- <i>You mean be a traitor.
- A traitor to what?</i>

1015
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,291
<i>To journalism.
You're a journalist, Hildy.</i>

1016
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,541
<i>A journalist? Hell, what does that mean?</i>

1017
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,750
Paul made
a braised pork sausage. Pretty tasty.

1018
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,541
Yours is in the microwave.

1019
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:29,500
Hey.

1020
01:15:32,333 --> 01:15:33,916
Hey.

1021
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:43,000
Do you believe in God?

1022
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,333
Uh... of course.

1023
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:49,666
Yeah.

1024
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,666
Yeah, no, of course.

1025
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,291
I, uh... I got your painting.

1026
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,666
It was... It was pretty.

1027
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:04,708
Thanks.

1028
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,125
Um...

1029
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:50,166
Big game this week.

1030
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:51,916
Uh, training.

1031
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:54,666
I'll, uh...

1032
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:56,833
I'll see you after?

1033
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,333
Yeah.

1034
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,916
- Um, cool.
- Okay.

1035
01:17:19,958 --> 01:17:22,625
Paulie,
are you marrying the garbage out there?

1036
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:45,000
<i>Looks like another blowout
with the Squahamish Moose down by 49.</i>

1037
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,125
<i>Fourth down on their own ten-yard line.</i>

1038
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:54,041
<i>Less than a minute left on the clock.
Players are lining up for the punt.</i>

1039
01:17:54,416 --> 01:17:56,541
- Hut!
<i>- Whoa, bad snap.</i>

1040
01:17:57,666 --> 01:17:59,875
<i>There's an awful lot of confusion
out there.</i>

1041
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,250
<i>Looks like the punter
is trying to free the ball up</i>

1042
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:05,125
<i>and salvage a few yards
out of this horribly crooked play.</i>

1043
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,125
Behind you!

1044
01:18:11,041 --> 01:18:14,083
<i>Oh! The punter takes a savage hit.</i>

1045
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,142
Come on, Munsky!

1046
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:19,125
<i>And Number 86 Paul Munsky's got the ball.</i>

1047
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:23,291
<i>Fifty! Forty!</i>

1048
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,250
<i>Thirty! Keep going!</i>

1049
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:29,041
<i>Keep going. He scores!</i>

1050
01:18:34,458 --> 01:18:38,875
<i>Squahamish Moose have scored!
First time in 15 years.</i>

1051
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:43,458
We're on the board! We're on the board!
We're on the board!

1052
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:46,416
We're on the board! We're on the board!

1053
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,833
Hey.

1054
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:03,708
- All hail the pride of Squahamish.
- Thanks.

1055
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,166
Uh...

1056
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:07,291
You, uh,
you didn't have to get me a Yakult.

1057
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:09,666
Oh. Yeah, take one.

1058
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,791
No, no, I don't, uh, want a Yakult.

1059
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:12,875
Good.

1060
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,666
Uh... Nah, I need to talk to you.

1061
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,625
Okay. Uh, my hands are full. Could you...

1062
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,250
Mmm.

1063
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:28,541
- So good.
- Uh, hey...

1064
01:19:29,333 --> 01:19:30,333
What?

1065
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:40,500
- What are you doing?
- You don't want me to kiss you?

1066
01:19:40,583 --> 01:19:42,125
- No!
- Why?

1067
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:43,750
Is there someone else?

1068
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,000
Aster.

1069
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:51,708
Aster, this is not...

1070
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:54,375
We're... We're not...

1071
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,250
You...

1072
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,250
- Paul.
- You, um...

1073
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:11,833
Uh...

1074
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:12,916
Um...

1075
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,791
You like Aster?

1076
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:26,125
It's a sin.

1077
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,708
You're going to hell.

1078
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,208
I'm onto you...

1079
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:01,916
Ellie Chu.

1080
01:21:04,083 --> 01:21:05,583
This is a nightmare.

1081
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,750
I know why you're always hanging around.

1082
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,416
Popping up everywhere.

1083
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:15,541
Okay,
it was just supposed to be one letter.

1084
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:17,385
- I didn't think...
- You're in love with me.

1085
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,208
Yes, Trig.

1086
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,375
I am in love with you.

1087
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:24,958
I get it.

1088
01:21:27,958 --> 01:21:29,083
Get away! Go home!

1089
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:31,333
Hey, hey, hey!
This is cashmere fleece, man!

1090
01:21:31,416 --> 01:21:33,176
- Get out!

Paul.

1116
01:23:41,666 --> 01:23:42,666
Sir?

1117
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:48,500
Did you and Ellie...

1118
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:50,458
mmm...

1119
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:52,291
break up?

1120
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,666
No, we weren't, um...

1121
01:23:57,958 --> 01:23:58,958
together.

1122
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:02,875
She seems...

1123
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,458
sad.

1124
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,041
No, you don't, um...

1125
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,250
see her.

1126
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,500
See?

1127
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,250
See what?

1128
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Who she is.

1129
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:34,958
Could be.

1130
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:39,791
Her.

1131
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:56,250
When Ellie's Ma died...

1132
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,625
I fell into a dark hole.

1133
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,166
I didn't move for days.

1134
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,083
A few days later...

1135
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,500
I woke to find Ellie in the booth...

1136
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,958
manning the switch.

1137
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:16,250
She looked up at me.

1138
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:22,333
Just 13... an adult already.

1139
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:26,458
And I...

1140
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,250
smiled.

1141
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,791
Have you ever loved someone so much...

1142
01:25:42,125 --> 01:25:44,541
you don't want anything about her...

1143
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,583
to change?

1144
01:25:52,958 --> 01:25:58,791
<i>♪ Holy, holy, holy ♪</i>

1145
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:05,083
<i>♪ Merciful and mighty ♪</i>

1146
01:26:05,416 --> 01:26:11,208
<i>♪ God in three persons ♪</i>

1147
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:17,541
<i>♪ Blessed Trinity ♪</i>

1148
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:23,583
Outside are the dogs, the...

1149
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:25,226
You're late.

1150
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,500
I had to grind something.

1151
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:28,833
And to close our Easter services...

1152
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:32,708
our final reading today
will be from Trig Carson.

1153
01:26:36,416 --> 01:26:37,541
"Love is patient.

1154
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:40,166
Love is kind.

1155
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:42,541
It does not envy.

1156
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,666
It does not boast.

1157
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,416
It is not proud."

1158
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,625
Which is why...

1159
01:26:49,208 --> 01:26:50,208
I love...

1160
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:52,458
this little lady.

1161
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:57,416
And why she'll make me a fantastic...

1162
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:58,833
wife.

1163
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:02,375
Aster...

1164
01:27:03,666 --> 01:27:04,666
will you?

1165
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:20,625
No!

1166
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:25,625
I, um...

1167
01:27:27,333 --> 01:27:28,333
Uh, um...

1168
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:31,916
Love isn't...

1169
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,333
It isn't...

1170
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,750
Thank you, Ellie.

1171
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,708
- Everyone...
- Love isn't pretending.

1172
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,875
Uh, I know, um...

1173
01:27:45,791 --> 01:27:47,416
because I've been pretending.

1174
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:50,958
Only for a few months, but...

1175
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:52,583
it sucks.

1176
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,208
Paul.

1177
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:58,666
And I've been thinking about how much
it would suck to have topretend to be...

1178
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:00,583
not you...

1179
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,083
uh... your whole life.

1180
01:28:07,041 --> 01:28:09,333
I always thought
that there was one way to love.

1181
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:11,625
Uh, one right way.

1182
01:28:12,916 --> 01:28:14,250
But there are more.

1183
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Uh, so many more than I knew.

1184
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:19,708
And...

1185
01:28:20,416 --> 01:28:23,083
I never want to be the guy
who stops loving someone...

1186
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,166
for loving the way that they want to love.

1187
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:31,583
And thank you, Paul.

1188
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,458
That was...

1189
01:28:35,083 --> 01:28:36,083
odd.

1190
01:28:37,458 --> 01:28:39,041
Now, let's give Trig...

1191
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:41,375
I also have been pretending.

1192
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,250
I've been pretending that...

1193
01:28:48,333 --> 01:28:52,208
Don't worry, everyone, I, uh...
I think I know where this is going. Um...

1194
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:56,625
Look, Ellie, I am so, so flattered, um...

1195
01:28:56,708 --> 01:28:59,291
- but, see, you and I are never...
- You know, Trig,

1196
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,916
I have been writing your papers
for the last four years.

1197
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,291
And if you'll forgive me...

1198
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:07,041
I'm just gonna rewrite you one last time.

1199
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,875
Love isn't patient and kind and humble.

1200
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,083
Love is...

1201
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:19,375
Love is...

1202
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,916
Love is messy.

1203
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,625
And horrible and selfish and...

1204
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,208
bold.

1205
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,333
It's not finding your perfect half.
It's...

1206
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:48,791
the trying...

1207
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:50,375
and...

1208
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:52,708
reaching and...

1209
01:29:53,625 --> 01:29:54,625
failing.

1210
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,750
Love is...

1211
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,208
being willing to ruin
your good painting...

1212
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,166
for the chance at a great one.

1213
01:30:19,833 --> 01:30:22,208
Is this really the boldest stroke
you can make?

1214
01:30:27,875 --> 01:30:28,875
You.

1215
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:32,750
Yeah.

1216
01:30:48,041 --> 01:30:49,125
Aster!

1217
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Everyone, please, take your seats.

1218
01:30:55,083 --> 01:30:57,291
Everyone, take your seats.

1219
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,708
Wait.

1220
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:00,750
So I'm the good painting?

1221
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:04,583
Mommy wants you to know, in case
you are gay, Mommy still loves you.

1222
01:31:04,666 --> 01:31:06,916
- I'm not gay, Mom.
- Thank God.

1223
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,458
I might want to change
our sausage recipe, though.

1224
01:31:09,541 --> 01:31:10,750
Are you insane?

1225
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,666
- I love that recipe!
- Whatever Dad said!

1226
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:18,875
Now that is some divine intervention.

1227
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,806
This is a lot of dumplings.

1228
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,375
Six days, 18 meals.

1229
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,291
To Grinnell.

1230
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,916
We didn't come here
so you could be like me.

1231
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,875
We came here
so you could be like your mother.

1232
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:26,041
You don't mean dead, right?

1233
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,041
God, I hope not.

1234
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:16,083
You haven't been to church.

1235
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,000
I'm busy.

1236
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,583
Yeah?

1237
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:23,833
Yeah.

1238
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:28,083
You need four portfolio pieces
for art school, so...

1239
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,500
Art school?

1240
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:31,041
That's great.

1241
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,833
Yeah, well, nothing's great yet,

1242
01:33:34,333 --> 01:33:35,333
but we'll see.

1243
01:33:37,583 --> 01:33:38,875
What's going on with you?

1244
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,166
Well...

1245
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:43,625
I'm headed east to Grinnell.

1246
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:47,000
- I'm leaving tomorrow...
- That's great, Ellie. Take care.

1247
01:33:48,916 --> 01:33:49,916
Aster!

1248
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:53,833
I'm sorry.

1249
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,500
It was just...

1250
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,833
supposed to be one letter.

1251
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,333
I never meant to hurt you.

1252
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,916
Deep down, I probably knew the truth.

1253
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,541
You really didn't use enough emojis
in his texts.

1254
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:38,166
I don't know what they mean.

1255
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,458
A puppy or...

1256
01:34:40,166 --> 01:34:43,000
- a sausage...
- I should have sent you a sausage emoji?

1257
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:44,958
Fair point.

1258
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,291
For what it's worth...

1259
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:56,416
it's not like the thought
never crossed my mind.

1260
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,250
You know...

1261
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,166
if things were different.

1262
01:35:05,541 --> 01:35:06,708
Or I was different.

1263
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:13,541
You could never be different.

1264
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,833
"Am I sure I'm different?

1265
01:35:17,166 --> 01:35:19,666
- How do I know I'm sure?"
- Hey, I can be sure.

1266
01:35:19,750 --> 01:35:21,166
"I mean, what does God think?"

1267
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:23,541
Oh, my God.

1268
01:35:23,625 --> 01:35:27,416
- And on, and on, and on, and on.
- And you know, you... you watch.

1269
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,708
Okay? In a couple of years,
I am gonna be so sure.

1270
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:31,833
Good luck with that.

1271
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:43,583
Find something good in Iowa
to believe in, heathen.

1272
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:07,541
I'll see you in a couple years.

1273
01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:10,250
I'll keep him busy tasting new ketchups.

1274
01:37:12,041 --> 01:37:13,333
Nice write-up in the <i>Town Crier.</i>

1275
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:15,125
Yeah, Munsky Sausages is gonna blow up.

1276
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:16,833
I might get to Iowa before you do.

1277
01:37:16,916 --> 01:37:17,958
I'd better get going then.

1278
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,708
Here.

1279
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:36,500
The caterpillar does look smart.

1280
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:39,541
Too smart to be crying on a platform
like a wussy.

1281
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:40,708
I'm not crying.

1282
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:41,791
Wussy.

1283
01:37:44,583 --> 01:37:45,583
Wussy!

1284
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:03,875
