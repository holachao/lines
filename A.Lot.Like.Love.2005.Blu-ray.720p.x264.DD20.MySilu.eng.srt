# I'm packed, and I'm holding,
I'm smiling, she living

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,880
Hey, does Mom know
you drive like that?

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,080
Whatever, OK?
Can you get your stuff?
I'm missing 90210.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
You're lucky you have
all that gear in your mouth,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
cos they'll need your teeth to
identify your charred remains.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,760
Shut up! You're such a dick!
Bye, Nicole.

WOMAN: Where is this coming from?

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
You can come, all right?
It's not...

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,720
Never mind. You don't want me 
to come, I'm not coming.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,640
Fine.
Then I want you out. Bye!

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Am I a partner, or am I not?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,800
You don't support me and my band.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,040
I support the band.
I love the band.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,320
Just get in the car.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,360
Don't hurry back.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,680
Come on!

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,400
You missed a spot right here.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
Can I clear these for you, sir?

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Will you be wanting
any more peanuts?

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,520
I think they have another crate
in the galley.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,200
Thanks.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Oh, dear. All right, then.
I'll just be getting you a towel.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,960
Oh, dear, I'm...
oh, I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm sorry.

KNOCKING

41
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,880
There's towels in here,
so I don't really need...

Everything all right, sir?
Every...yeah.

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,040
Everything's good. Thanks.

49
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,920
PA: Your attention, please.

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,800
There has been a luggage carousel
change for flight 640.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,760
It will now be on carousel 4.

52
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't.

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm Oliver.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,440
I just thought
we'd chat it up...

55
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,920
Blah, blah, blah.
See, it's ruined.

56
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,920
What's ruined?

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,560
Our little secret.

58
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,280
Actually, I think the stewardess
was kind of onto us, so...

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,960
Well, she'll have to be killed.

60
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm Oliver.
You keep saying that.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,400
Wow. You don't make it
easy for a guy.

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,720
I think I made it pretty easy
for ya, Oliver.

63
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
So, what's Bon Jovi do?

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,440
Who?

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
Boyfriend.

66
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,520
Ex-boyfriend.

67
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,040
Yeah, I noticed that.

68
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,160
So, what happened there?

69
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,960
What, are we friends now?

70
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
I'd say we're a little bit more
than friends.

71
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,440
Bon Jovi get a big record contract
or somethin'?

72
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,000
His name's not Bon Jovi.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,720
Oh.

74
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
He plays guitar.

75
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
Everyone plays guitar.

76
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
You play guitar?

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,200
No.

78
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,480
Strike two.

79
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,080
Strike two?

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
What was strike one?

81
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,120
Would you like to sit
next to your girlfriend?

82
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,240
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,040
"So, what's your deal, Oliver?

84
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,920
You in New York on business?"

85
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,640
"Me? Oh, uh...
well, thank you for asking.

86
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,560
"No, actually I'm here
visiting my brother.

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,240
"He's a lawyer... Well, he's going
to be. He's in law school, so..."

88
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,480
Is that what you wanna do, too?

89
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,840
I don't know.

90
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
I just finished school.

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,360
Don't people usually
graduate in June?

92
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah.

93
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,880
It's almost a year ago.
You still don't have a job?

94
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Who are you, my mom?

95
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
I don't know. When you look at me,
do you see your mom?

96
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,040
What sign are you?

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,680
What sign am I?

98
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,240
Cancer.

99
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,160
Strike three.

100
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
Thanks.

101
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,360
It's Emily.

102
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,000
I'd have never guessed Emily.

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,720
Don't get mugged.

104
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,000
Nice to meet you too, Oliver. I'm
Carol. I've heard a lot about you.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm sorry.
I thought you were...

106
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
Yeah.

107
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,880

IMITATES ELVIS PRESLEY:
Thank you very much.

109
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,840
# It ain't no joke
I'd like to buy the world a toke

110
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,080
# And teach the world to sing
in perfect harmony

111
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,880
# And teach the world to snub the...

112
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,560
Where'd it go?
What?

113
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,240
My jacket.
It was right there.

114
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,360
What jacket?

115
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,400
# This is a love attack 

116
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,240
# I know it went out, but it's back

117
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
# It's just like any fad...

118
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,720
I ain't seen no jacket.

119
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,040
What?

120
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,280
What can I get for 20?

121
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,720
20?

122
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,240
Dollars?

123
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,160
# So don't delay, act now,
supplies are running out

124
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,000
# Allow, if you're still alive,
six to eight years to arrive

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,960
# And if you follow
there may be a tomorrow

126
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,600
# But if the offer's shunned

127
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,480
# You might as well
be walkin' on the sun

128
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,280
# You might as well be
walkin' on the sun

129
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,040
# You might as well
be walkin' on the sun. #

130
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,560
You know, kissing a smoker
is like licking an ashtray.

131
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,520
Really?
What's screwing one like?

132
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,640
You stalking me?

133
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,120
Yes.

134
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,800
Oh, somebody
stole my jacket.

135
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,720
What are you doing?
You wanna do something?

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,360
What,
are we friends now?

137
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,720
Ah, here she is.

138
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
I thought you were using
the ladies'.

139
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,080
I was. But, um...

140
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,960
SHE COUGHS
I just came out to get some air.

141
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Hi, I'm Brent,
Emily's father.

142
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,880
Hi. Oliver.

143
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,320
Christine.
My stepmother.

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
So, you ready
for some Guggenheim?

145
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,560
You know what?
Can I...would you mind
if I skipped the museum?

146
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,080
Oh, Em,
Christine took off work.

147
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,040
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just, um...

148
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,320
Would you mind
if I tell them?

149
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,040
No, not at all.
Go ahead.

150
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,520
Oliver is getting some test results
back today,

151
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,720
and he was just wondering
if I could go with him.

152
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,560
It's a scary time.
It's OK.

153
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,080
So it won't take long.
Oh, don't you worry
about that.

154
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,800
You take as long as you need.

155
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm sure everything
will turn out fine.

156
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,840
You'll see.

157
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,160
Good luck.

158
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,720
I'll see ya later?
OK.

159
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,600
Thanks.

160
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,880
You know, stuff like that's
not even funny.

161
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,360
You only get one chance
to make a first impression.

162
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
What do you care
what my dad thinks?

163
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,400
What if we hit it off,
become a thing or something?

164
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,560
What was that?
You and I would never
become a thing.

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,720
Oh! You really think pretty
highly of yourself, don't you?

166
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
First of all,
why would I get mixed up

167
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,880
with a guy
who I know first-hand

168
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,800
will jump into
an airplane bathroom

169
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,040
with the first girl
that comes a-knockin'?

170
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,560
That was with you.

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,400
You don't wanna
get mixed up with me
because I slept with you?

172
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,320
Second of all,
you're not even close
to being my type.

173
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,440
Well, I'm not lookin' for
a girlfriend anyway, so...

174
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,160
And thirdly,
it turns out
you might be gay.

175
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
I mean, I want a girlfriend.

176
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,520
Whatever.

177
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,400
Just first things first,
you know?

178
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,320
What things?

179
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,520
I don't know.

180
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,040
Just make a plan
and get all my ducks in line.

181
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,520
You mean ducks in a row?

182
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,240
Yes, I mean ducks in a row.
Well, what ducks are those?

183
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,160
Like the normal kind
of ducks...

184
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Like job, career,
house, future.

185
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,760
And what,
then the girl of your dreams
will just come and find you?

186
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
Yep.

187
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
I'll find her.
We'll find each other.

188
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't worry about me
and girls, OK?

189
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,720
I do all right.

190
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,400

Stop. Get outta here.

193
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,960
You're not unattractive.

194

Mm-hmm.

197

# Oh, yeah

200
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Two more?

201
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,400
You know what? I still got stuff
to do today, so...

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,800
So do I.

203
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,240
You know what?
Make 'em doubles.

204
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
They are doubles.

205
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,880
# Let's delay our misery

206
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,840

211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You know what?
I got it.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,840
I know.

213
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
You know.

214
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,760
You know what?
I don't mind paying,

215
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,040
But I hate the fact that
you assume that I'm paying.

216
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,120
That's just...I mean,
at least make a move.

217
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,040
Like, make the reach
for it or something.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,880
What if you don't get
your ducks in a row?

219
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,080
I'll get my ducks in a row.
In a line.

220
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,640
What if
it takes 20 years?

221
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,480
It's not gonna take 20 years.
It's gonna take five years.

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,280
Six, maybe. Max.

223
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,160
You don't even
have a job.

224
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,400
You don't even have
an inkling of a job.
See, that's not true.

225
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm kinda interested
in all the stuff going on
with the internet.

226
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,960
Well, that's good.
I hear that's gonna be huge.

227
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,280
It will be.

228
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,400
I'm sure.

229
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Are you being sarcastic?
No!

230
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,000
I think you're gonna be
beating away chicks with a stick.

231
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,880
Do you really think
that six years from now,

232
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,640
a guy like me,
with a job, a house,

233
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,520
a car...a nice car...
and a future,

234
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,320
you think I'm gonna have
a problem findin' somebody
to fall in love with me?

235
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,560
Oh, I think you're gonna
have a big problem.

236
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,320
You...

237
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,600
What are you doing?

238
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,760
I am writing down
my parents' phone number.

239
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,720
You live with your parents?
No.

240
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,600
Yes. But not
in six years, I won't.

241
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
What does six years have
anything to do with it?

242
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,960
Yeah, well, if you let me
finish, it's my whole...
it's my whole point.

243
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,240
Six years from now,
you call this phone number.

244
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,080
My parents
will answer the phone.

245
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,760
You ask 'em how to reach me.

246
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,720
They'll give you the number.

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Then you call my house,
and when my beautiful wife
answers the phone,

248
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,240
Then you can ask her where to
send the 20 bucks you owe me.

249
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
20 bucks? I thought
you were gonna be some
hotshot businessguy.

250
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,080
Fine.

251
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,120
50. 50 big ones.

252
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,560
50 it is.

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,800

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Give me the camera.

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,360
Would you give me
the camera?

You're very shootable.

OK, thank you.

No, I got a callback.

00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,400

my lines with me before I go?

What are you doing?

324
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm going.

325
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Honey, you don't have to go.
I'm going.

326
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
You can have
two whole hours here.
No, Em.

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,040
I mean...

328
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,720
I'm going.

329
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,320
I'm sorry.

330
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Martin, please,
listen to me.

331
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,120
LINE READER: Let go, Alexa.

332
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,520
It can't end this way,
Martin, not like this.

333
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,440
You should've thought
of that before, Alexa.

334
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,480
Don't turn your back
on me, Martin.

335
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,320
You owe me more than that.

336
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,280
I don't have any more
to give, Alexa.

337
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,480
You've taken it all.

338
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,720
I'm sorry, just...
Look at me, Martin...

339
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,320
DIRECTOR: OK, thank you.

340
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,920
Sorry. I just lost
my place. Sorry.

341
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,320
Emily, Emily, it's...
it's very, very good.

342
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,200
Just try and keep in mind
how much you love him.

343
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,640
Martin?
Yeah.

344
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
OK.
He's the love
of her life, OK?

345
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,720
So how would that make her feel
if he was leaving her?

346
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,360
Desperately unhappy?
Exactly.

347
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,600
Just one more thing. Try and keep
in mind she's a vampire.

348
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,520
OK, here we go.
And action.

349
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,280
You're better off.
That's what I think.

350
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,720
Of course
she's better off.

351
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,120
Dumps you right before New Year's.
It's awful.

352
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,800
I didn't want to say
anything to you while
you were seeing him...

353
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,680
Here, Dallas.
It's always gotta be
about him.

354
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,080
Well, I didn't see Peter
that way at all.

355
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,840
He could be too nice.

356
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,560
Yeah, I guess you're right.
But she's still better off.

357
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,320
Oh, she is much better off.
She's better off.
When it's over, it's over.

358
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,800
You're coming tomorrow,
aren't you, Em?
She's coming.

359
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,360
Hey, how about a blind date?
I know someone.

360
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,120
You can't take a blind date
to New Year's.
Why?

361
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Why? Because it's
a blind date. You don't roll
the dice on New Year's.

362
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,040
Well, you don't go to New Year's
alone, either.

363
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,920
Why not? I'm going alone.
Well, that's you.

364
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,040
And what's that
supposed to mean?
I'm just sayin'.

365
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,440
The point is
is that it's New Year's,

366
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
and you know,
date or no date,

367
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,560
You just don't
spend New Year's alone.

368
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,920
Don't. She quit.

Hi. Um, is David there?

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,600
Hi. Is Chris there?

377
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,400
Hi. I was looking for Frank.

# A stick and stone
may break the bone

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,520
# But it don't quench the fire...

380
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah. No, most people... most
normal people have plans, you know,

381
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,480
Being that it's New Year's
and all, but thanks anyway.

382
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
Do you happen
to know if he...

383
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
if he'll be back later or...

384
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,240
Oh.

385
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,640
What's your name?

386
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,680
# Now stepping stones
and lickin' bones

387
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,520
# And cast them all aside

388
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,920
# I wonder what
she's looking for tonight

389
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,520
# And there she goes again

390
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
# There she goes again

391
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,640

Yes, just a second.
Oliver!

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,200
Yeah?
Telephone!

Hello.

403
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,880
Oliver?
This is.

404
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,520
This is Emily.

405
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,680
I don't know
if you remember me.

406
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,880
Wait. Emily, New York Emily?

407
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,920

Hello?
I got it, Ellen.

410
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,280
OK. God, I didn't know.
Sorry.

411
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,720
What a goofball, huh?

412
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,120
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
You still there?

413
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
Yeah, yeah. I'm here.

414
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
So what's up?

415
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
No, I was just...
I was just wondering...

416
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,120
I just came across your number
all of a sudden,

417
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,040
And I was just thinking to myself...

418
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,640
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT
You know, "Wow, I wonder
what Oliver's doing."

419
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,080
You know, I know that
you're probably busy tonight,

420
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,000
But I was just wondering
if you wanted to grab
a coffee this afternoon.

421
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,040
Sure.
So, really?

422
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,480
ELLEN: Oliver.
I'm on the phone, Ellen.

423
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,320
I know.
When you gettin' off?
I'm expecting a call.

424
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
You got a pager, Ellen.

425
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,120
But I can't talk on a pager.
Ellen, get off the phone!

426
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,960
You are such a dick!

427
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,120
Get off the phone, Ellen!

428
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,640
Mom, tell Ellen
to get off the phone.
Ellen!

429
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,400
Hello? Sorry about that.

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,000

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
Uh, where are you?
I ll come over.

433
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,800
Now?

434
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,600

Hi.

442
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,640
I'm Emily.

443
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm Oliver.

444
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,280
You're not Oliver.

445
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,360
Ahh!

446
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,000
That's it? I thought you'd at least
invite him in.

447
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,480
You owe me 10.

448
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,960
I knew he wasn't you.
You're not that good-looking.

449
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
She didn't say that.
Wait, what did he say?

450
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,160
What did he tell you I said?
I said you were good-looking.

451
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,920
Told you.
That's what I said.

452
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,480
You...

453
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
He's a little...
He's saying you're crazy.

454
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Yeah, I got that.

455
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,400
HORN HONKS

456
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,000
Did she honk?

457
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Why?

458
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,640
My wife. I'm going.

459
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,280
Bye.
Bye. Bye.

460
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,080
Hi.
Hi.

461
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,080
You look different.
So do you.

462
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,360
But, like, good different.
You, too. I like your hair.

463
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,600
Thank you.

464
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm still signing.

465
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,320
Why? I don't know.
I'm stopping. OK.

466
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,160
Your brother screen
all your dates?

467
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,480
This is a date.

468
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,040
Can I get you anything to drink?
A tea or a soda?

469
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,920
I'm good, thanks.
Just go grab a beer.

470
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,840
I can't believe
you just assumed

471
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,680
That this was
what this was about.

472
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,840
You can't...
you can't believe I assumed
that what was about the what?

473
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,920
Because I'm not the same girl
you met three years ago.

474
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,840
I mean, I'm the same girl,

475
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,240
But it's not at all
the same situation.

476
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,280
Right. I understand.

477
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,560
I'm not one of those girls
who needs to sleep with someone
after every stupid breakup

478
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,960
Just to prove
she's still got it. I...

479
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,040
Yeah.

480
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,880
What are you doing?

481
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,840
I am looking
for your crazy pills.

482
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
You know, they have to be
around here somewhere

483
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,640
for moments like these, right?

484
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,240
That's not funny.

485
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,200
What if I really was crazy?

486
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,280
Have you eaten today?

487
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,800
How can you live in LA
And not have a car?

488
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,160
I had a car. Then I sold it.

489
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,680
I needed the capital
for my business.

490
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,120
That's right.
The plan. The ducks.

491
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,120
It's all coming back
to me now.

492
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,360
Only...two and a half more years
until you're rich.

493
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Is your beautiful wife gonna live
in your parents' basement with you?

494
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,440
I don't live
with my parents.
Just visiting?

495
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,240
No, I was just pickin' some
stuff up, cos I'm moving.

496
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,600
"Diaperush.com"?

497
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,840
That's what it says.
We sell diapers on the internet.

498
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,720
I thought the whole internet thing
was done already.

499
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,440
No. Just need
a good business plan.
Diapers?

500
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,560
So, how's Bon Jovi?

501
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,160
Does he still rock?

502
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,360
Who?

503
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,640
Oh, him. He switched bands
and moved to Seattle.

504
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,560
Nice. Hope he knows
how to steam milk

505
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,720
and make those little
chocolate shavings.

506
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,680
Big talk coming
from a diaper salesman.

507
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,960
Oh, OK.

508
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,320
And the latest breakup?
What's he do?

509
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,440
Is he a baseball player
or a cosmonaut?
Who said I had a breakup?

510
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,720
You did,
in your kitchen during
your hypoglycemic rant.

511
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,360
So? Spill it.
Who's the guy?

512
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,320
I'm not telling you.

513
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,960
Did you dump him?
No. He dumped you.

514
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm not gonna talk
about it.

515
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,080
OK. Fine. Then I'm
not talkin' at all.

516
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,680
You're not talking?
You ain't gettin' boo
outta me.

517
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,920
Fine, I'm not
talking, either.

518
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,400
SHE COUGHS

519
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,200
SHE CHOKES

520
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,200
Are you OK?

521
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,680
OK, fine. I'll tell you.

522
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,080
Mmm.
My brother's deaf, Em.

523
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,560
I can go days
without talking.

524
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,040
Can we get a check,
please?

525
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,480
I met him in class.

526
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,120
Yeah? You went back to school?

527
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,720
Acting class.

528
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,680
Oh, he's an actor.

529
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,720
Wow, actors.
That's like one rung up
from musicians.

530
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,680
He was a writer.
Is a writer.

531
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,040
Hmm. Hi. Could I
get a coffee?

532
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,800
Mm-hmm.
Just regular black.

533
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,440
After you.
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

534
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,600
Frappuccino, please.
OK.

535
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,120
I believe the question
was who dumped whom?

536
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,800
He left me.

537
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,480
I got it.
No, I got it.

538
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,240
No, but I appreciate
the reach.

539
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,080
The acting classes are really
paying off, but I got it.

540
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,920
Shut up. I got it.

541
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,760
So what are your plans?

542
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,560
Plans for what?
Tonight.

543
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
It is New Year's.

544
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,080
Yeah. I'm not a really big
New Year's guy.

545
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,480
Bunch of amateurs
getting drunk.
Yeah.

546
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,440
Yeah.

547
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,760
Cringy people wearing
those party hats.

548
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,560
Ah! The hats.

549
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,000
Lame.

550
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,240
I know of a party.
Really?

551
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,720
Let's go.

552
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,440
You got more clothes
in your trunk

553
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,280
Than I got
in my whole closet.

554
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,240
Try this.

555
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,960
Nice.
Is this Bon Jovi's?

556
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,560
Am I supposed to act

557
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
Like I'm some big
Hollywood-producer type
or something?

558
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,200
Just be yourself.

559
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,560
Except maybe don't mention
the whole diaper thing.

560
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,000
Hey, Emily,
I gotta ask you somethin'.

561
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,520
Hey, do you mind?
Sorry.

562
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
What? What do you
have to ask me?

563
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Well, what
was strike one?

564
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,360
What?

565
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,960
In New York.

566
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,680
Strike two was that I
didn't play guitar.

567
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,120
Strike three was that
I was born under
the wrong star sign.

568
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,080
What was strike one?

569
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,480
Strike one was that
I had to make the first move.

570
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,240
I got strike one
before we even met?

571
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,600
You can't get strike one
before you step up
to the plate.

572
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,280
You drive.

573
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,040
MUSIC PLAYS

574
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,400
I introduced myself.
What?

575
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,160
In New York.

576
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,520
I introduced myself.
That's not a move?

577
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Who called who today?
I didn't have your number.

578
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
You never asked.

579
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,480
SHE GASPS
You came!

580
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,040
And with a young man
in tow.

581
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,440
This is Michelle
and Michelle's fiance Michael.

582
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,080
Hi.

583
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,360
Oliver.

584
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,640
I sell diapers.

585
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,760
Well, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah.

586
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,920
Hello, ladies.

587
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,480
Oh, my God!
Look at you.

588
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,320
Get you a drink?
I'm good, thanks.

589
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,600
I think I'll get one.

590
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,640
Uh-uh. You are not
getting off that easy.

591
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,560
He's an old friend.

592
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,080
I wish I had
an old friend

593
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
that looked like that.
He's gorgeous.

594
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Come on, give it up.

595
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,200
Uh-oh.

596
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,800
Very carefully,

597
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,720
I want you to move backwards

598
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,040
in the direction of the bar.

599
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,560
TELEPHONE RINGS

600
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,680
Hello?

601
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,040
Ellen, it's me.

602
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,880
What do you want, Oliver?

603
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,960
Listen, I'm at this
big Hollywood party,

604
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,280
And I just ran into
that...the white rapper
guy you like.

605
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,080
Eminem? No way!

606
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,200
So listen.
So I'm sitting at the bar,
right, and we're talking,

607
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,800
and outta nowhere,
he starts running his hand

608
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,840
up and down my leg.

609
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,920
Happy New Year, Ellen.

610
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,040
You're such a dick, Oliver.

611
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,320
Thank you.
Eminem's here?

612
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,320
Who is he talking to, her?

613
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,480
Some guy.

614
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,280
Now he's talking to her.
She just kissed him.

615
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,720
Kissed who?
Peter. She's kissing Peter.

616
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,760
Is he kissing her back?

617
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,360
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you.

618
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,760
It sounded like you said
you sell diapers.
There you are!

619
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,920
Come on.

620
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,960
# Feel the vibe,
feel the terror, feel the pain

621
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,080
# It's drivin' me insane

622
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,680
# I can't fake,
for god's sakes

623
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,200
# Why am I drivin'
in the wrong lane?

624
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,560
# Trouble is my middle name,
but in the end, I'm not too bad

625
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,400
# Can someone tell me
if it's wrong to be so mad...

626
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
Put your hands on my ass.
That'll really get him.

627
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,080
# Mad about you

628
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,160
SHE GIGGLES

629
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,240
Do you want me to put my hands
on your ass?

630
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,480
You all right?
Yeah.

631
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,480
I'm gonna go...I'm gonna
go to the ladies' room.

632
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
I'll be right back.

Clearly...

644
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,600
Clearly, you're not a fan of...
Shh!

645
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,160
You're cl...
I'm serious.

646
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,680
My neighbours are, like,
flip-out kind of people.

647
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,800
Ooh.
Ooh.

648
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,240
OK, that's enough.

649
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,000
Having a problem?

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,200
Very serious.

651
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,800
You OK?
I'm fine.

652
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,160
Oliver.

653
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
You've been robbed.

654
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,680
I'm moving.
You are?

655
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah. I told you.

656
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
You did?

657
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,960
Well, it's official.
The power's off.

658
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,800
When did you tell me?

659
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,400
Earlier.

660
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,080
My business,
it's in San Francisco.

661
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,240
When are you leaving?

662
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,440
Tomorrow.

663
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,920

Ah, nice. Thank you.

665
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,560
Hey, I took this.

666
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,200
Yeah, I know.

667
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,440
You framed it.

668
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,840
Yeah.
I liked it.

669
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,440
You framed my picture.

670
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,600
It's a good picture.

671
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,120
Wow.

672
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,640
Just when
I'm starting to like you,
you're moving away.

673
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,000
Can I tell you something?
Mm-hmm.

674
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,600
I think that...

675
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,040
That it's time that...

676
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,520
I think it's time
that I stop...

677
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,640
..being somebody's...

678
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,560
..girlfriend.

679
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,920
Hold on one second.
Just one sec.

680
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,840
Don't move.

681
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,640
Emily?

682
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,160
Emily?

683
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,240
SHE SNORES

684
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,760
You OK?

685
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,440
SHE MUMBLES

686
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,200
You gonna throw up?

687
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,640
SHE SNORES

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,080
DOOR CLOSES
Hey, baby!

689
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,600
I'm home.

690
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,200
Sorry I'm late.
I got hung up at the office.

691
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,840
On the phone with some
bean counters from Huggies.

692
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,600
Did you remember
the wine?

693
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,600
The what?
The wine.

694
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,160
I forgot. You know what?
I'll get it right now.

695
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,760
Mm-mmm. Don't bother.
I already picked it up.

696
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,760
Why'd you ask me if I got it
in the first place?

697
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,800
Because I knew you wouldn't remember
that I asked you.

698
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,480
I knew you'd forget it.

699
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,240
Well, that's something
of a self-fulfilling
prophecy, then, huh?

700
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,680
Do you know what, Oliver?
You're never here.

701
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,640
And even when you are here,
you're still not here.

702
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,120
I'm here right now.

703
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,440
You seen my red shirt?

704
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,080
I can't do it anymore,
Ollie.

705
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,160
Can't do what?

706
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,920
This.

707
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,840
What are you trying to say?

708
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,400
I don't know, Ollie.
I just...

709
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,240
I think we need
to take a break.

710

MUSIC: "Trouble"
by Ray LaMontagne

712
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,800
# Trouble

713
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,920
# Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble

714
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,520
# Trouble been doggin' my soul...

715
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,000
Hi. Do you mind
if I just...

716
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,440
Oh, I'm sorry. I was...
I was gonna get that.

717
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,240
Well, there's a bunch more.
Right. You wanna trade?

718
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,600
No, thanks.
I'm gonna take this one.

719
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,200
Aha. So I see you knew
it was the import.

720
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,440
Very sneaky. Very sly.
It's got the acoustic b-side.

721
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,600
Yes, and a bonus track.
So you see my dilemma.

722
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,920
I can't possibly allow you
to walk out of this store
with the last copy.

723
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,360
I'm not just gonna walk out.
I'm gonna pay for it first.

724
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,240
Wait a minute.
Don't I know you?

725
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,360
Oh, jeez, spare me
the pickup line. Here.

726
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,520
No, it wasn't a pickup line.
I do know you.

727
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,000
Michelle's wedding.
Michelle Foster.

728
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,920
I went to school
with her husband.

729
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,840
Oh. Yeah, wait.
Ben something.

730
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,400
That's right. Ben Miller.
That's right. And you are...

731
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
CLICKS FINGERS

732
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,440
Uh, Emily.

733
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,360
Here.

734
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,080
No, I couldn't.

735
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,120
Come on. Just take it.
Really, it's yours.

736
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,480
No, just take it.
Seriously, I feel bad. Take it.

737
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,640
It's yours.

738
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,840
You know you want it.
I do want it.

739
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,680
Take it. Here.

740
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,600
Really?
Yeah.

741
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,640
Can't believe
you just took it.

742
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,280
Airport.
Yeah.

743
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,880
Dude. Dude,
this is what I want,

744
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,280
Exactly like this...
all black like Batman.

745
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,800
Very cool.
Yep.

746
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,800
What are you doin'?
Test-driving.
Hop in the back, dude.

747
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,400
Yo, you should get one, too,
like Batman and Robin.

748
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,240
Except without the tights.

749
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,600
It's like...
where you gonna park it?

750
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,080
This thing? Wherever I want.

751
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,000
I mean, this...
we're not in the money yet.

752
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,960
You heard your brother,
all right?

753
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,280
I mean, we wow 'em in New York,
it's a lock.

754
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,320
Come on. Hop in.

755
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,200
You know what?
I'm gonna stick around here
and finish some stuff up.

756
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,120
Would you relax, please?

757
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,000
Dude, take a step back, man.
You're startin to depress me.

758
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,400
Go take a weekend off. Do
somethin'for yourself, all right?

759
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,400
SHUTTER CLICKS

760
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,760
Beautiful.

761
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,280
Gorgeous.
Come on, Hailey.

762
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,040
Wait. Hailey!

763
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,800
Hailey, hold on.

764
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,640
Sweetie.

765
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,320
Oh, my God,
are you guys kidding?

766
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,600
Get a room.

767
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,760
Oh, I can't help it.
He's so hot.

768
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,680
Hi. Emily.

769
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh, thank God
you can't get pregnant
when you're pregnant.

770
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Hi.

771
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,800
So, you and Ben went
on a little date, huh?

772
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,320
Yeah. We had lunch.

773
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,240
It was nice.

774
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,560
And that's all I'm gonna
get outta you, isn't it?
Yeah.

775
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,120
Well, then I should probably
get back to work.

776
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,920
Bye, hon.
Bye, sexy.

777
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,360
Bye.
Bye.

778
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,920
Lunch? What's the matter?
You don't like him?

779
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,680
Why do you say that?
Just cos we didn't jump
right into the sack?

780
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,400
What's jumpin' in the sack?

781
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,320
It's a game people play
at picnics, honey.

782
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,600
Hey.

783
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,280
I do weddings, head shots, 
baby showers...

784
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,880
You know, for the money.

785
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,640
But I met a girl at a party...
she owns a gallery...

786
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,560
And she said she might
show my work there, so...

787
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,080
That's really cool.
How'd you do that?

788
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,840
You leave the shutter open.

789
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,400
The hard part's staying still.
Otherwise, you're just a blur

790
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,400
Like the cars in the background.

791
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,960
I'm gonna go splash
some water on my face,

792
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,280
so make yourself at home.

793
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,400
Wait, he just landed on your
doorstep? Honey, that's perfect.

794
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,160
Don't get excited.
He lives 400 miles away.

795
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,120
Emily, let's not get picky.

796
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,000
And I couldn't look
less sexy.

797
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Oh, stop it.
You're gorgeous.

798
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,520
Has he put the moves on you yet?
He's not the type.

799
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,040
Someone's gonna have sex.

800
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,800
Shh. Will you stop it.
I gotta go. Wish me luck.

801
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,040
You don't need it.
Call me.

802
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
Thank you.

803
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,800
You're welcome.

804
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,800
I mean, she owned
a business, right?

805
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,320
Like, selling antiques.

806
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,240
And she used to work
for the mayor's office
as an advisor,

807
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,080
But she said
she didn't like it, so...
wow, two careers already.

808
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,200
Yeah. So I thought
that she would understand,

809
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,880
you know, the kind of work
that you gotta put in

810
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,120
when you're first
startin' out, but...

811
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,760
she said that she couldn't be
number three or number four

812
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,760
on someone's list
of priorities.

813
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,760
She said
she could be number two,

814
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,960
But not if number one
was selling diapers.

815
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,200
TELEPHONE RINGS

816
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,800
MICHELLE: Hi.
It's me calling to see
how things are going.

817
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,720
This is...hi. Hello?

818
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,080
It's
a work-related call.
I'll just be one second.

819
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,200
Yes, can you get the...
please figure out
if the negatives

820
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,680
are gonna be ready
by tomorrow.

821
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,280
What?!
How's it going?

822
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,920
It's not.
It'll be fine,

823
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,000
As long as you're not wearing
that orange sweatshirt.

824
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,640
Don't call back here.

825
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,680
Sorry about that.
I just...

826
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,040
Where are you going?

827
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,440
What's your stance
on pancakes?

828
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,840
I'm pro pancakes.

829
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,920
Do you know
what you're gonna have yet?

830
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,040
I just can't...

831
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,280
I can't decide
what to get.

832
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,200
Come on, Ollie,
you gotta just let it go.

833
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,200
Smile.

834
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,200
You're here with me.

835
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,640
There it is.
That's the one.

836
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,240
Hi.

837
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,480
Oh, my God, Gina, hi!
How are you?

838
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,360
I'm good. How are you?
I'm good. It's been
such a long time.

839
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,800
Really long, yeah.

840
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,240
I've been meaning
to call you.
Me, too.

841
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,200
I was hoping that
we could actually get together
and talk a bit.

842
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,000
Yeah, that would be great.

843
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,600
It would be good.
Yeah.

844
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,240
Do you have
a couple of bucks
for the waitress?

845
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,640
Em. Hi.

846
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,080
Hey.
Uh, it's...

847
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,600
How's everything?
How are you?
I'm good.

848
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,360
Yeah?
Yeah.

849
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,400
You're good? Oh, great.

850
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,640
I was gonna sneak on by,
but then I thought,

851
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,000
"I saw you, so you probably saw me"
and...

852
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,680
Yeah, no, it's good
that you both said hi.

853
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,880
I knew
that she'd be fine with it.

854
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,280
I mean, it's been
a long time.

855
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,000
Yeah, no,
I m glad you sa...

856
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,960
Hi.
Hey.

857
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,200
Oliver.
Peter.

858
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,520
Oh, Oliver.
Good to see
you again.

859
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,960
Um, you know,
we should probably go

860
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,160
if we're gonna
catch that film.
Oh. You're right.

861
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,240
Em, take care.
Yeah, take care.
It was good to see you.

862
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,400
Bye.

863
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,120
Nice meeting you!

864
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,880
Oh, I'm starvin'.

865
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:28,040
Let's get outta here.
OK.

866
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,480
All right!

867
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,960
Come on. Let it go.

868
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,160
Smile. You're with me.

869
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,040
Shut up.

870
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,800
SHE HONKS HORN

871
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,560
Get off the road, grandma!

872
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,480
Come on.

873
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,200
Let it go.
Smile. You're with me.

874
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,920
No.
Hmm? Hmm?

875
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,680
Where we goin'?

876
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,680
We're headin' north.

877
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,960
I've been killin' myself
at work.

878
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,760
Nights, weekends.

879
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,760
Even at home.
Well, Bridget's home.

880
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,800
See, I moved in with her.

881
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,400
That was my big mistake
right there.

882
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,120
I shoulda stuck with the plan.
I mean, the plan was working.

883
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,920
You know, the irony of it

884
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,800
is that Bridget
actually loves plans.

885
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,720
We used to go on these trips.

886
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,560
She would plan everything

887
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,080
down to, like,
the very last detail.

888
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,840
I mean, like, including, like,
the gas station that we were
gonna stop at.

889
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,760
MUSIC ON RADIO:
"If You Leave Me Now"
by Chicago

890
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,840
I remember this one time.
We were in Ashland, right?

891
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,280
SHE SINGS: Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oh,
baby, please don't go

892
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,400
We were at this
b&b station, right?

893
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,680
# If you leave me now... 
And it starts raining, right?

894
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,680
And I'm not talkin'
about regular rain.

895
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,880
It was like
torrential-downpour rain.

896
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,000
# Ooh-ooh-ooh, no,
baby, please don t go...

897
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,520
So Bridget comes up
with this great idea, right?

898
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,320
# Just want you to stay
Park the car in the car wash,

899
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,720
because who's gonna wash
their car when it's raining?

900
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,600
# A love like ours
is love that's hard to find

901
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,960
# Find

902
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,080
BOTH: # How could we
let it slip away?

903
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,640
Come on.

904
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:45,920
# We've come too far
to leave it all behind

905
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,560
# How could we let it slip away?

906
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,280
# When tomorrow comes...

907
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,680
MUMBLES WORDS

908
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,160
# ..today...

909
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,200
THEY LAUGH

910
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,480
Do you want something?

911
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,480
Um, just...
just pick something.

912
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,560
SHE LAUGHS

913
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,720
Did you buy the whole store?

914
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,680
Aah!

915
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,280
Mmm.

916
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,880
Want some pie?

917
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,120
You want some Cheetos?

918
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,840
Oh, look at the moon.

919
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,800
Mm.

920
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,320
Let's pull over.

921
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,280
Did you love him? Peter?

922
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,040
No.

923
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,720
Maybe a little.

924
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,960
Do you love Bridget?

925
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,160
Yeah, I guess so.

926
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,440
Well, do you, or don't you?

927
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,280
I thought I did.

928
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,080
Well, if it wasn't love,
it was a lot like it.

929
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,000
OK, now I don't know.

930
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,840
Sounds stupid
when I say it out loud.

931
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,240
Honestly, if you're not
willing to sound stupid,

932
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,840
you don't deserve
to be in love.

933
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,240
Take this.
What?

934
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,480
What was that?

935
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,360
What?
That.

936
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,920
I didn't hear
anything.

937
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:05,960
Aah!

938
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,920
Oh, my God! Oh!

939
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:11,600
Oh, my God. Are you OK?
Ollie, are you OK?

940
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,360
Aah!

941
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,360
Whoa, you just looked.
No, I didn't.

942
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,760
You said
you weren't gonna look.
I didn't look. Go.

943
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,440
I looked.

944
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,920
Ooh, looking good.
Shut up.

945
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,080
Ooh, very nice.

946
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,360
You're just taking advantage
of me right now. Come on.

947
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,360
OK, the shutter's
gonna stay open
for 40 seconds.

948
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,560
You have to keep
very still, OK?
OK.

949
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,360
Are you ready?
Ready.

950
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,560
CAMERA WHIRRS

951
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,000
Ooh! Ow! Ow!
Ooh, it's cold.

01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,280
# I never understood before

954
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,440
# I never knew what love was for

955
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,880
# My heart was broke,
my head was sore

956

# What a feeling...

957
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,320
Hi.
No moving.

958
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,280
# Tied up in ancient history

959
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:21,480
# I didn't believe in destiny

960
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,280
# I look up, you're standin'
next to me...

961
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:27,320
You're moving.
I can't help it.

962
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:31,200
# What a feelin' in my soul

963
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,120
# Love burns brighter
than sunshine

964
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,560

01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:50,200
# Suddenly

968
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,200
# Suddenly you're mine

969
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:58,520
# And it's brighter than sunshine

970
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,840
# I never saw it happening

971
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,800
# I'd given up and given in

972
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,280
# I just couldn't
take the hurt again

973
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,840
# What a feelin'

974
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,120
# I didn't have the strength to fight

975
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:19,280
# But suddenly it all seemed so right

976
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,680
# Me and you

977
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,960
# What a feelin'

978
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,040
# What a feeling... 

979
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,160
Folks, can I talk to you
out here for a second?

980
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,240
# Love burns brighter
than sunshine...

981
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,720
Folks.

982
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,600
# Let the rain fall, I don't care

983
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:46,880
# I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine

984
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,240
# Suddenly you're mine

985
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,840
# And it's brighter
than sunshine. #

986
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,280
Folks,
this is a national park.

987
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,920
Why don't you get
back in your clothes,

988
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:02,560
back in your car,

989
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,080
and back on the highway.

990
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,440
Have a nice day.

991
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,800
I gotta go.

992
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,360
OK.

993
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
So anyway,
we got this, uh,

994
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,760
big VC meeting in New York.

995
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,200
Gotta put on this big
dog and pony show.

996
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,280
You know what VC is, right?

997
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,360
No.

998
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,960
It's venture capital.

999
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,880
It's like a big influx of cash

1000
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,840
to really help us
grow our business.

1001
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:55,040
It sounds exciting.

1002
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,480
I'll grab this.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1003
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,040
Well...

1004
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,680
..you got my number.

1005
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,880
And you've got mine.

1006
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,640
Yes, I do.

1007
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,680
So I'll let you know
how things go...
in New York.

1008
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:43,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good.

1009
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,400
I've still got some...

1010
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:56,440
Some, like, feelings
to sort through, about...

1011
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,320
Bridget?
Yeah.

1012
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,440
I didn't forget.
It's "Bridget."

1013
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,360
I...

1014
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,840
It's...
It's OK.

1015
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,560
Is it?

1016
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,840
Yeah.

1017
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:13,360
I met someone.

1018
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,320
You met someone?

1019
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,440
Yeah, I mean, it's not
like we're getting married
or anything, but...

1020
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,680
Wait, now I'm... I'm confused.

1021
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,680
This...this is someone different?
Not the writer guy?

1022
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:27,880
Yeah, no, a different guy.
A new guy.

1023
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,480
A different guy?

1024
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,440
What?

1025
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,240
I don't...
you know, it's...

1026
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,360
Thank you.

1027
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,520
So...

1028
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,480
Don't.

1029
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,680
You'll ruin it.

1030
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,360
Get outta here.
I'm sick of you.

1031
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,680
Pitch and go. Pitch and go.
Keep up the pace.

1032
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,600
It's not a big deal.
I'm sorry.

1033
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,320
It actually is quite a big deal. 
But don't go too fast.

1034
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,720
Ollie, you get really jittery when
you go too fast.

1035
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,440
I need to make sure
that you don't speed
through the whole thing

1036
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,840
in such a way
that nobody understands
exactly what you're saying,

1037
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,480
because we invested
a lot of time...
Jeety.

1038
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,960
Jeeto, I need you
to shut up. All right?

1039
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,040
This is exactly
what I'm talkin' about.
You're driving me crazy.

1040
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,480
So...
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

1041

01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,120
The...

1043
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:07,080
MOUTHS: Client.

1044
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,800
The client inputs
the child's data,

01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,760
and the baby actually
tracks its growth.

1046
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,000
So when it's time
to move up to a bigger size...

1047
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,480
..there it is...bam...
just on your doorstep.

1048
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:25,520
No hassle. No fuss.

1049
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,480
Does the baby have a name?

1050
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,040
Does the baby have a name?

1051
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,760
Yes.

1052
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,680
What were we saying
for the baby's name?

1053
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,800
Freddy.

1054
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,680
Freddy.

1055
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,120
Doesn't have to be Fred.

1056
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,640
Gabe was another choice
that we came up with.

1057
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,640
Gabe the babe.

1058
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,240
My point is is that there are
10,000 babies born every hour.

1059
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,120
That's 254,000 babies a day.

1060
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,600
Somebody's gotta figure out
where to put all that shit.

1061
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,720
I wanna be that guy.

1062
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,080
10,000 babies an hour.

1063
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,400
Wouldn't that be
240,000 babies a day?

1064
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,080
Yes.

1065
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:38,160
It was good, Ollie.
You were great.

1066
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,600
There was that one little thing,
but I don't think it was a big deal.

1067
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,560
How about you?
You think it was good?
Great.

1068
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:47,320
PHONE RINGS
It's mine.

1069
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,200
Hey, I'm Jeeter.
How ya doin'?

1070
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,760
Hello?
EMILY: Ollie?

1071
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,440
Hi.
Are you still
in New York?

1072
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,400
Can you hold on one second?
It's bad reception.

1073
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,880
I found it.

1074
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,040
How does it look?

1075
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,800
Looks good.

1076
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,560
She was young, huh?
Yeah.

1077
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,800
What kind of flowers
did you get?

1078
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,960
Blue?

1079
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,560
That's perfect.

1080
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,400
Today's her birthday.

1081
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,240
Talk to me.

1082
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,920
I don't know what to say.

1083
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,760
Doesn't matter.

1084
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,600
All right.

1085
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,160
There's...

1086
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,520
There's this kid, OK?

1087
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,600
And he's in his backyard,
and he's diggin' a hole.

1088
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:24,480
And the neighbour lady
looks over the fence and says,

1089
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,920
"What you doing over there,
little Johnny?"

1090
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,560
And the kid looks really sad,

1091
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,360
And he says,
"Well, my goldfish died,

1092
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:36,760
"so I'm having a funeral
for it."

1093
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,480
And the lady says,

1094
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,720
"well, that s
an awfully big hole
for a goldfish."

1095
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,120
And little Johnny says,

1096
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,120
"Well, that's because
he's inside your stupid cat."

1097
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,000
You know,
that's terrible.

1098
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,160
Thank you.

1099
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,360
PA: Final call
for Flight 701 to Los Angeles.

1100
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,960
This flight is now closing.

1101
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,800
Excuse me. Are you travelling with
us to Los Angeles, sir?

# No-one to blame...

1111
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,240
She lives in Los Angeles,

1112
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,960
and my work is
in San Francisco,

1113
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,200
so that's...

1114
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,960
And look, if this
VC money comes in,

1115
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,560
we're gonna be swamped
anyway, so...

1116
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,440
But it's like,
that's just...

1117
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,360
How can I be there for her

1118
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,360
if I don't even have my thing
figured out, you know?

1119
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,240
I...I can't.

1120
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:23,160
And I was clear with her
right from the top that...

1121
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,160
Like, the first day
that we met,

1122
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,360
I told her that I had to
have my things,

1123
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,320
my work and stuff,
that...

1124
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,520
So you won't
be traveling with us
to Los Angeles, then?

1125
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,280
No.

1126
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,720
OK.

1127
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,080
Hi.

I'm Natalie.

Nice to meet you, Natalie.
Good to meet you, too.

1131
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,680
You know, in about 24 hours,
I'm gonna be rich.

1132
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:23,800
Really?
Yeah.

1133
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,880
You from New York?
No. I'm from LA.

1134
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,480
OK. Did I mention
I was gonna be rich?

1135
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,880
You did, actually.
Yeah?

1136
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,120
Yeah.
You like that?

1137
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,600
It's...it's interesting.

1138
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,920
Natalie, what would you do
with 6.2 million, hypothetically?

1139
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,240
Should we check it?
Check it.

1140
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,480
DIALLING TONE
Does it work?

1141
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:51,880
There's dial tone.

1142
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,480
Maybe we should call them.

1143
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,800
No. They said Friday afternoon.

1144
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,480
It's still Friday afternoon.

1145
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,880
But it's not Friday
afternoon in New York.

1146
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,160
Seriously, we should
just give 'em a call.
They'll call.

1147
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,320
We don't wanna look desperate.

we'll talk to you
next week, then.

Thank you.

I'm gonna miss her.

1166
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:26,840
Well, no-one can say
we didn't try, right?

1167
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,960
Just need the keys.

1168
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,520
Oh. Yeah.

1169
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,280
Hey, can I hang on
to the key chain?

1170
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:38,240
They're, like, 25 bucks.

01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,960
You serious?

1172
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,360
Yeah.

1173
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,280
Aw, keep it.

1174
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,400
Thanks.
Yeah.

1175
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,000
You, uh, need a ride?

1176
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,200
Just gonna clear some stuff
out of my office.

1177
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,960

01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,160
Just don't say anything,

1219
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:13,760
cos I'll lose my nerve.

1220
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,040
# As my broken heart
lies bleeding

1221
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,120

it's suicide

1222
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:31,720
# You say you cried
a thousand rivers

1223
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,800

for the shore

1224
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:42,840
# You left me drowned in,
in my tears

1225
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,760
# And you won't save me anymore

1226
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,680
# I pray to god you give me
one more chance, girl 

1227
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:55,360
# I'll be there for you

1228
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,960

1229
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,840

I wanna be the air for you

1230
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,680

1231
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:07,800
# I'd live, and I'd die for you

1232
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,320

1233
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,400

01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,160
I know you like Bon Jovi, so...

1238
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,240
I don't.

1239
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:36,080
Emily...

1240
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,160
I'm flat broke.

1241
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,640
I don't have a job.
I don't have a plan...

1242
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,160
And I know I'm...

1243
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,160
I know I'm probably
six years too late...

1244
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,960
But will you give me
strike one back?

1245
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,680
You're married.

1246
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,680
I'm engaged.

1247
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,640
Do you wanna come in?

1248
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,480
No. I think I need the air.

1249
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,680
I'm...
I have to get the baby.

1250
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,760
I'm sitting
for Michelle.

1251
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:36,400
You sound really good.

1252
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,280
Well...

1253
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,800
Guess when I'm an old man,

1254
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,080
I'll never have to wonder,

1255
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,240
"What if...?"

1256
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:02,120
MAN: So how long
have you had this place, Ben?

1257
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,800
Going on four years,

1258
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,160
but I still have
a lot of plans for it.

1259
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:09,000
WOMAN: Oh, I'm sure Em would be
happy to help you with those plans.

1260
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,040
I'm sure she will.

I don't even recognise you.
Ugh! That skirt.

1276
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,400
Oh, those are great boots.
Do you still have those?

1277
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,400
Not the boots.
Well, what am I looking
for here? The guy?

1278
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,560
No, not the guy.
Whatever happened to that guy?

1279
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,760
The photos.
They're from before we met.

1280
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,840
Before you and who met?
Me and Oliver.

1281
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,400
What are you talking about?
He took them before
I even saw him,

1282
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:36,960
So he did make
the first move.

1283
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,960
Kind of.

1284
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,160
You ready?
I gotta go.

1285
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:43,560
I'm gonna stop by tomorrow, OK?
I'll help you move.

1286
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,960
Where you going?
Michael needs a new suit.

1287
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,160
I can't let him shop alone.

1288
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,200
Talk. Tell me.
Do I look fat?

1289
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,720
Seriously. The pinstripes,
they make me look fat?

1290
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:03,800
Michael,
this is the seventh suit
you've tried on today.

1291
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,720
What do you want me to say?
It's a suit.

1292
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,440
Oh, I just need
some, you know, give
in the shoulders.

1293
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,120
I just need a little...
They do alterations.

1294
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:11,880
Move.
BABY SHRIEKS

1295
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,520
Yeah.
Shirts, huh?

1296
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,040
That's a nice shirt.
Look at this one.

1297
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,640
Shirts.

1298
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,400
SALESMAN: Those legs,
they go all the way
to the floor.

1299

Socks. Yeah.

1300
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:25,040

Hold on now.

1301
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,840
We don't want
our pants falling down
in the middle of "I do."

1302
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,840
Nobody wants to see that.

1303
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,040
Thought you quit smoking.

1304
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,160
I did.

1305
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,160
What's goin' on, Em?

1306
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,600
Oh, all right,
what are you doing?

1307
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,000
I don't care.
You have to wait.

1308
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,400
Mom!
What?

1309
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,360
Have you seen my tie?
Did you look in your room?

1310
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,480
Yes. I don't know
where it is.

1311
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,560
You better find it.

1312
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,320
Is that my tie?

1313
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:25,600
Mom.
What?

1314
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,600
Graham took my tie.
Why would he take your tie?

1315
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,480
I don't know.
Why? Give it to me.

1316
01:30:31,480 --> 01:30:33,640
Hi. I've been trying
this number all morning,

1317
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,880
And I was just wondering
if you could find out

1318
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,800
If there's something
wrong with the line
or if it's been disconnected

1319
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,800
Or if I can make
an emergency breakthrough.

1320
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:44,760
She's sleeping.
OK. OK. Thanks anyway.

1321
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:46,000
Is everything packed?
I brought the minivan.

1322
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,800
I'm not moving.

1323
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:50,200
What's going on?

1324
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,640
Ben and I broke up.

1325
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:57,400
Honey.

1326
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,600
Are you OK?
Why didn't you call me?

1327
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,000
What happened?

1328
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,400
I had to do this.

1329
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:06,880
OK.

1330
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,720
We are gonna sit down,
and we are going to take
a deep breath.

1331
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:13,600
It's gonna be fine.

1332
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,840
It is so natural
to be nervous before
you get married.

1333
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,320
Do you remember me?

1334
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,600
Don't worry.
Ben is gonna understand.

1335
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,600
You just need to talk to him.
Just set a time to meet.

1336
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,320
Tell him you
need a day or two
to think things over.

1337
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,800
I have to call Oliver.
Oliver?

1338
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,720
Who doesn't have call waiting?
Sweetie.

1339
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,160
I have to talk to him.
I have to tell him
I'm not getting married.

1340
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,240
Stop. Give me the phone.

1341
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,360
I saw him.

1342
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:40,440
You saw who?

1343
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:43,360
Oliver.

1344
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,000
Emily...

1345
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,880
He's getting married.

1346
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,800
When?

1347
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,080
Hi. I have a phone number,

1348
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,000
and I was wondering if
you could give me the address

1349
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,840
That goes
with that phone number.
What are you gonna say?

1350
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,720
I'm gonna say
I broke it off with Ben.
I'm just gonna tell the truth.

1351
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:16,400
Oh, no, no.
I wasn't speaking to you. Sorry.

1352
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,600
OK, you ready? Here it is.

1353
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,080
I forgot the number.

1354
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,480
Find the number.
Hold on. I'm looking.
I'm looking.

1355
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,240
She's looking.
She's looking.

1356
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,760
Big day.
Hey.

1357
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:38,960

1358
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:41,320
Ready? Yeah.

Shall I call a doctor?

01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,520
I'll get somebody to help you.
Go get somebody to help her.

1364
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,640
Call 911.
Just get her some ice...

1365
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,440
Are you OK?

1366
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,560
I got it. I got it.
I'm sure there's a doctor...

1367
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,840
I got her. It's fine.
OK.

1368
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,040
You OK?
Yeah.

1369
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,880
What are you doing here?
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

1370
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,560
Excuse me. Are you here
with the ice?

1371
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,080
How did you find me?
I had your number,
and I just...

1372
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:10,840
I called information
and got your address.

1373
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,360
Wow. Information sure gives out
a lot of information.

1374
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:14,520
I got this.

1375
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:16,080
It's good, thanks.

1376
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,440

# I never knew what love... 

1388
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,280
Oliver!

1389
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,840
What's going on?

1390
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,600
You're not too late.

1391
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,640
I'm not getting married.
My sister is.

1392
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,640
You're such a dick.

1393
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,120
# Tied up in ancient history

1394
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,960
# I didn't believe
in destiny...

1395
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,760
Let's go. Let's start without him,
you guys. Come on.

1396
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,160
Let's go.

1397
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:33,080
Don't.

1398
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:34,920
You'll ruin it.

1399
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,920
# What a feeling in my soul 

1400
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,680
# Love burns brighter
than sunshine

1401
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,520
# Brighter than sunshine

1402
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,360
# Let the rain fall,
I don't care

1403
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,040
# I'm yours,
and suddenly you're mine

1404
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,640
# Suddenly

1405
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,920
# Suddenly you're mine

1406
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:04,920
# And it's brighter
than sunshine

1407
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:09,360
# I never saw it happening

1408
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,440
# I'd given up
and given in

1409
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,920
# I just couldn't take
the hurt again

1410
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,880
# What a feeling

1411
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,720
# I didn't have
the strength to fight

1412
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:25,800
# But suddenly
it all seemed so right

1413
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,440
# Me and you

1414
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,760
# What a feeling

1415
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,640
# What a feeling in my soul

1416
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,880
# Love burns brighter
than sunshine

1417
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,440
# It's brighter than sunshine

1418
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,880
# Let the rain fall

1419
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,320
# I don't care

1420
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,680
# I'm yours

1421
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:52,600
# And suddenly you're mine

1422
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,080
# Suddenly you're mine

1423
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:01,280
# And it's brighter
than the sun

1424
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,560
# It's brighter than the sun

1425
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:11,120
# It's brighter than the sun,
sunshine. #
