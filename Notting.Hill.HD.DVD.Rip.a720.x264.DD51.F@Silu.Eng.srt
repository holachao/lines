Oh. Hi.

Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...

you can be really genuinely cool...

just a hundred percent.

Well, happy birthday.

- You haven't slept with her, have you?

542
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:15,641
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, of course, no comment.

543
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,644
- No comment means "yes."
- No, it doesn't.

- Do you ever masturbate?
- Definitely no comment.

- [ Honey ] Oh, my God!

So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do?

- I'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

What do you do?

549
00:37:32,994 --> 00:37:36,760
I'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

Though, um-- um, I have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.

"Careful there, Vicar."

Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

554
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:54,638
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they?
- They can be.

555
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:56,683
I see friends from university--

They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

You know, it's no life.

559
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:10,362
- What sort of acting do you do?
- Films, mainly.

560
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:15,334
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies?

561
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:20,306
I mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid?

562
00:38:20,374 --> 00:38:22,604
Fifteen million dollars.

563
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,612
Right.

564
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,878
So that's, well, fairly good.

Oh, sorry.

- What did you say to her?

I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

I was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.

- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what I've long suspected--

that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

getting promoted above me.

Well, um--

2844

so... I'm leaving.

Thank you.

Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

2851
03:20:26,965 --> 03:20:30,366
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

2852

Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

2853
03:20:37,309 --> 03:20:40,107
But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

2854
03:20:40,178 --> 03:20:43,272

So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

I have to go away today, but I...

2867
03:21:31,096 --> 03:21:34,395

let me see you a little,

See if you could like me again.

2871
03:21:48,046 --> 03:21:50,480
But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

2872
03:21:50,548 --> 03:21:53,312
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

2873
03:21:54,686 --> 03:21:57,780
I heard.

You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

2875
03:22:01,126 --> 03:22:03,117
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

2876
03:22:03,194 --> 03:22:05,788

in England?

2877

I'll ring her back?

2880
03:22:17,042 --> 03:22:20,136
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

2881
03:22:20,211 --> 03:22:22,179
and it's now been about 24 hours...

is now sort of blackish in color and--

3841
04:33:05,610 --> 04:33:07,544
would be well advised to keep quiet.

3842
04:33:07,612 --> 04:33:08,817
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

3843
04:33:08,817 --> 04:33:09,784
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.

3844
04:33:09,852 --> 04:33:13,049
Um, I ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--

3845
04:33:13,122 --> 04:33:17,286
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.

3846
04:33:17,359 --> 04:33:19,793
And then I-- Right. Okay.

3847
04:33:19,862 --> 04:33:23,696
Say, who was that rather diffident chap
I saw you talking to round the back?

3848
04:33:23,766 --> 04:33:25,700
No one.

3849
04:33:27,102 --> 04:33:30,128
Just some guy from the past. I--

3850
04:33:30,205 --> 04:33:34,141
It's a bit of an awkward situation.
I don't know what he's doing here.

3851
04:33:51,260 --> 04:33:53,194
'Course.

3852
04:33:58,967 --> 04:34:02,061
Thanks. I've got to, um--

3853
04:34:02,137 --> 04:34:04,071
Any time.

3854
04:34:13,649 --> 04:34:17,085
[ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks?

3855
04:34:17,152 --> 04:34:19,279
On your first marks!

3856
04:34:31,400 --> 04:34:34,733
Uh, I-I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

3857
04:34:34,803 --> 04:34:38,000
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

3858
04:34:38,073 --> 04:34:40,439
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself?

3859
04:34:40,509 --> 04:34:45,037
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

3860
04:34:46,114 --> 04:34:47,706
Right. Okay.

3861
04:34:47,783 --> 04:34:52,482
Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would I
have to pay it as much as I pay you?

3862
04:34:56,658 --> 04:34:59,491
Hi.

3863
04:34:59,561 --> 04:35:01,654
Hello.

3864
04:35:01,730 --> 04:35:03,857
You disappeared.

3865
04:35:03,932 --> 04:35:06,560
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

3866
04:35:06,635 --> 04:35:10,503
I had to leave.
I didn't want to disturb.

3867
04:35:10,572 --> 04:35:14,565
- How have you been?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

3868
04:35:14,643 --> 04:35:18,739
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

3869
04:35:18,814 --> 04:35:21,874
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

3870
04:35:21,950 --> 04:35:24,180
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

3871
04:35:24,253 --> 04:35:27,689
It's-- It's all nonsense, believe me.

3872
04:35:27,756 --> 04:35:30,725
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

3873
04:35:30,792 --> 04:35:32,726
nonsense it all is.

3874
04:35:34,897 --> 04:35:37,365
Well, um--

3875
04:35:37,432 --> 04:35:42,460
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... I'm leaving.

3876
04:35:44,606 --> 04:35:48,064
But, um--

3877
04:35:48,143 --> 04:35:51,772
I brought this for you from home,

3878
04:35:51,847 --> 04:35:54,077
so I thought I'd give it to you.

3879
04:35:55,517 --> 04:35:58,452
Thank you.

3880
04:35:58,520 --> 04:36:00,454
Shall I--

3881
04:36:00,522 --> 04:36:03,116
Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

3882
04:36:05,961 --> 04:36:09,362
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

3883
04:36:09,431 --> 04:36:13,925
Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

3884
04:36:16,305 --> 04:36:19,103
But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

3885
04:36:19,174 --> 04:36:22,268
having behaved so badly.

3886
04:36:22,344 --> 04:36:24,278
Twice.

3887
04:36:25,881 --> 04:36:30,045
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

3888
04:36:30,118 --> 04:36:34,452
Then you came and... I figured--

3889
04:36:38,093 --> 04:36:40,459
The thing is--

3890
04:36:40,529 --> 04:36:42,463
The thing is--

3891
04:36:45,233 --> 04:36:48,134
What? What is the thing?

3892
04:36:49,371 --> 04:36:51,703
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

3893
04:36:51,773 --> 04:36:54,435
- Go away.
- Right.

3894
04:36:54,509 --> 04:36:56,443
Sorry.

3895
04:36:58,714 --> 04:37:01,148
You were saying?

3896
04:37:03,652 --> 04:37:07,110
Yes.

3897
04:37:07,189 --> 04:37:10,022
I have to go away today, but I...

3898
04:37:10,092 --> 04:37:13,391
wondered if I didn't...

3899
04:37:13,462 --> 04:37:17,865
whether you might
let me see you a little,

3900
04:37:17,933 --> 04:37:20,800
or... a lot, maybe.

3901
04:37:24,072 --> 04:37:26,973
See if you could like me again.

3902
04:37:27,042 --> 04:37:29,476
But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

3903
04:37:29,544 --> 04:37:32,308
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

3904
04:37:33,682 --> 04:37:36,776
I heard.

3905
04:37:36,852 --> 04:37:40,049
You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

3906
04:37:40,122 --> 04:37:42,113
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

3907
04:37:42,190 --> 04:37:44,784
to the most indiscreet man
in England?

3908
04:37:46,228 --> 04:37:48,560
Uh, excuse me.

3909
04:37:48,630 --> 04:37:51,064
It's your mother on the phone.

3910
04:37:53,835 --> 04:37:55,962
Will you tell her
I'll ring her back?

3911
04:37:56,038 --> 04:37:59,132
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

3912
04:37:59,207 --> 04:38:01,175
and it's now been about 24 hours...

3913
04:38:01,243 --> 04:38:04,679
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and--

3914
04:38:04,746 --> 04:38:08,512
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

3915
04:38:10,686 --> 04:38:13,484
Martin, hold the fort a second.

3916
04:38:13,555 --> 04:38:15,921
Uh, yes. All right.

3917
04:38:21,063 --> 04:38:23,588
Um, could I just say--

3918
04:38:23,665 --> 04:38:28,728
[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

3919
04:38:29,971 --> 04:38:32,633
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes.

3920
04:38:32,708 --> 04:38:35,768
[ Chuckles ]

3921
04:38:35,844 --> 04:38:39,746
Um, I've always wondered...

3922
04:38:39,815 --> 04:38:43,012
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

3923
04:38:43,085 --> 04:38:46,748
I can't say that I know Patrick
all that well.

3924
04:38:46,822 --> 04:38:49,086
He wasn't that friendly during filming?

3925
04:38:49,157 --> 04:38:54,595
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

3926
04:38:57,065 --> 04:38:59,431
Oh. Oh, right.

3927
04:38:59,501 --> 04:39:01,435
Sorry.

3928
04:39:03,071 --> 04:39:06,336
Always been a bit of an ass.
[ Chuckling ]

3929
04:39:06,408 --> 04:39:09,377
Um, anyway-- Um--

3930
04:39:09,444 --> 04:39:11,378
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

3931
04:39:11,446 --> 04:39:13,880
I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

3932
04:39:13,949 --> 04:39:17,578
And Demi's, of course.

3933
04:39:20,088 --> 04:39:22,318
Sorry.

3934
04:39:22,390 --> 04:39:24,255
That's fine.

3935
04:39:24,326 --> 04:39:28,126
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

3936
04:39:30,398 --> 04:39:33,561
Anna, look, um--

3937
04:39:33,635 --> 04:39:37,435
I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

3938
04:39:37,506 --> 04:39:41,374
not often in and out of love.

3939
04:39:41,443 --> 04:39:43,570
But, uh--

3940
04:39:48,116 --> 04:39:50,516
Can I just say no to your...

3941
04:39:50,585 --> 04:39:54,919
kind request and, uh, leave it at that?

3942
04:39:58,326 --> 04:40:01,659
Yes.

3943
04:40:01,730 --> 04:40:05,257
Fine. Of course. I--

3944
04:40:05,333 --> 04:40:07,392
Of course.

3945
04:40:09,104 --> 04:40:12,164
I'll just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.

3946
04:40:12,240 --> 04:40:15,175
The thing is,

3947
04:40:15,243 --> 04:40:18,701
with you I'm in real... danger.

3948
04:40:18,780 --> 04:40:21,977
It seems like a... perfect situation,

3949
04:40:22,050 --> 04:40:25,508
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

3950
04:40:25,587 --> 04:40:30,149
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not...

3951
04:40:30,225 --> 04:40:33,023
recover, uh, if I was...

3952
04:40:33,094 --> 04:40:37,155
once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

3953
04:40:37,232 --> 04:40:42,397
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

3954
04:40:42,470 --> 04:40:45,837
You'd go and I'd be, uh,

3955
04:40:45,907 --> 04:40:48,535
well, buggered, basically.

3956
04:40:50,045 --> 04:40:52,980
That really is a real no, isn't it?

3961
04:41:07,429 --> 04:41:11,763
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

3962
04:41:15,470 --> 04:41:18,997
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know?

3963
04:41:22,811 --> 04:41:26,440
And don't forget I'm--

3964
04:41:26,514 --> 04:41:30,314
I'm also just a girl...

[ Honey ]
Yeah, good move.

3970
04:42:17,243 --> 04:42:19,939
I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

3971
04:42:20,013 --> 04:42:21,947
I saw her taking her trousers down,

3972
04:42:22,015 --> 04:42:24,882
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

3973
04:42:24,951 --> 04:42:27,784
Good decision, yeah.

- Never met her, never want to.

- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

isn't the original, is it?

she wanted to go out with you.

sort of... sweet, actually.

I know she's an actress and all that...

3992
04:43:39,626 --> 04:43:45,531
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

3994

05:22:52,842 --> 05:22:54,776
No one.

4512
05:22:56,178 --> 05:22:59,204
Just some guy from the past. I--

4513
05:22:59,281 --> 05:23:03,217
It's a bit of an awkward situation.
I don't know what he's doing here.

4514
05:23:20,336 --> 05:23:22,270
'Course.

4515
05:23:28,043 --> 05:23:31,137
Thanks. I've got to, um--

4516
05:23:31,213 --> 05:23:33,147
Any time.

4517
05:23:42,725 --> 05:23:46,161
[ Man ] Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks?

4518
05:23:46,228 --> 05:23:48,355
On your first marks!

4519
05:24:00,476 --> 05:24:03,809
Uh, I-I do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,

4520
05:24:03,879 --> 05:24:07,076
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.

4521
05:24:07,149 --> 05:24:09,515
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself?

4522
05:24:09,585 --> 05:24:14,113
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

4523
05:24:15,190 --> 05:24:16,782
Right. Okay.

4524
05:24:16,859 --> 05:24:21,558
Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would I
have to pay it as much as I pay you?

4525
05:24:25,734 --> 05:24:28,567
Hi.

4526
05:24:28,637 --> 05:24:30,730
Hello.

4527
05:24:30,806 --> 05:24:32,933
You disappeared.

4528
05:24:33,008 --> 05:24:35,636
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

4529
05:24:35,711 --> 05:24:39,579
I had to leave.
I didn't want to disturb.

4530
05:24:39,648 --> 05:24:43,641
- How have you been?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

4531
05:24:43,719 --> 05:24:47,815
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

4532
05:24:47,890 --> 05:24:50,950
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

4533
05:24:51,026 --> 05:24:53,256
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

4534
05:24:53,329 --> 05:24:56,765
It's-- It's all nonsense, believe me.

4535
05:24:56,832 --> 05:24:59,801
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

4536
05:24:59,868 --> 05:25:01,802
nonsense it all is.

4537
05:25:03,973 --> 05:25:06,441
Well, um--

4538
05:25:06,508 --> 05:25:11,536
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... I'm leaving.

4539
05:25:13,682 --> 05:25:17,140
But, um--

4540
05:25:17,219 --> 05:25:20,848
I brought this for you from home,

4541
05:25:20,923 --> 05:25:23,153
so I thought I'd give it to you.

4542
05:25:24,593 --> 05:25:27,528
Thank you.

4543
05:25:27,596 --> 05:25:29,530
Shall I--

4544
05:25:29,598 --> 05:25:32,192
Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

4545
05:25:35,037 --> 05:25:38,438
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

4546
05:25:38,507 --> 05:25:43,001
Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

4547
05:25:45,381 --> 05:25:48,179
But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

4548
05:25:48,250 --> 05:25:51,344
having behaved so badly.

4549
05:25:51,420 --> 05:25:53,354
Twice.

4550
05:25:54,957 --> 05:25:59,121
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

4551
05:25:59,194 --> 05:26:03,528
Then you came and... I figured--

4552
05:26:07,169 --> 05:26:09,535
The thing is--

4553
05:26:09,605 --> 05:26:11,539
The thing is--

4554
05:26:14,309 --> 05:26:17,210
What? What is the thing?

4555
05:26:18,447 --> 05:26:20,779
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

4556
05:26:20,849 --> 05:26:23,511
- Go away.
- Right.

4557
05:26:23,585 --> 05:26:25,519
Sorry.

4558
05:26:27,790 --> 05:26:30,224
You were saying?

4559
05:26:32,728 --> 05:26:36,186
Yes.

4560
05:26:36,265 --> 05:26:39,098
I have to go away today, but I...

4561
05:26:39,168 --> 05:26:42,467
wondered if I didn't...

4562
05:26:42,538 --> 05:26:46,941
whether you might
let me see you a little,

4563
05:26:47,009 --> 05:26:49,876
or... a lot, maybe.

4564
05:26:53,148 --> 05:26:56,049
See if you could like me again.

4565
05:26:56,118 --> 05:26:58,552
But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

4566
05:26:58,620 --> 05:27:01,384
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

4567
05:27:02,758 --> 05:27:05,852
I heard.

4568
05:27:05,928 --> 05:27:09,125
You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

4569
05:27:09,198 --> 05:27:11,189
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

4570
05:27:11,266 --> 05:27:13,860
to the most indiscreet man
in England?

4571
05:27:15,304 --> 05:27:17,636
Uh, excuse me.

4572
05:27:17,706 --> 05:27:20,140
It's your mother on the phone.

4573
05:27:22,911 --> 05:27:25,038
Will you tell her
I'll ring her back?

4574
05:27:25,114 --> 05:27:28,208
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

4575
05:27:28,283 --> 05:27:30,251
and it's now been about 24 hours...

4576
05:27:30,319 --> 05:27:33,755
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and--

4577
05:27:33,822 --> 05:27:37,588
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

4578
05:27:39,762 --> 05:27:42,560
Martin, hold the fort a second.

4579
05:27:42,631 --> 05:27:44,997
Uh, yes. All right.

4580
05:27:50,139 --> 05:27:52,664
Um, could I just say--

4581
05:27:52,741 --> 05:27:57,804
[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

4582
05:27:59,047 --> 05:28:01,709
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes.

4583
05:28:01,784 --> 05:28:04,844
[ Chuckles ]

4584
05:28:04,920 --> 05:28:08,822
Um, I've always wondered...

4585
05:28:08,891 --> 05:28:12,088
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

4586
05:28:12,161 --> 05:28:15,824
I can't say that I know Patrick
all that well.

4587
05:28:15,898 --> 05:28:18,162
He wasn't that friendly during filming?

4588
05:28:18,233 --> 05:28:23,671
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

4589
05:28:26,141 --> 05:28:28,507
Oh. Oh, right.

4590
05:28:28,577 --> 05:28:30,511
Sorry.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

4591
05:28:32,147 --> 05:28:35,412
Always been a bit of an ass.
[ Chuckling ]

4592
05:28:35,484 --> 05:28:38,453
Um, anyway-- Um--

4593
05:28:38,520 --> 05:28:40,454
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

4594
05:28:40,522 --> 05:28:42,956
I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

4595
05:28:43,025 --> 05:28:46,654
And Demi's, of course.

4596
05:28:49,164 --> 05:28:51,394
Sorry.

4597
05:28:51,466 --> 05:28:53,331
That's fine.

4598
05:28:53,402 --> 05:28:57,202
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

4599
05:28:59,474 --> 05:29:02,637
Anna, look, um--

4600
05:29:02,711 --> 05:29:06,511
I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

4601
05:29:06,582 --> 05:29:10,450
not often in and out of love.

4602
05:29:10,519 --> 05:29:12,646
But, uh--

4603
05:29:17,192 --> 05:29:19,592
Can I just say no to your...

4604
05:29:19,661 --> 05:29:23,995
kind request and, uh, leave it at that?

4605
05:29:27,402 --> 05:29:30,735
Yes.

4606
05:29:30,806 --> 05:29:34,333
Fine. Of course. I--

4607
05:29:34,409 --> 05:29:36,468
Of course.

4608
05:29:38,180 --> 05:29:41,240
I'll just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.

4609
05:29:41,316 --> 05:29:44,251
The thing is,

4610
05:29:44,319 --> 05:29:47,777
with you I'm in real... danger.

4611
05:29:47,856 --> 05:29:51,053
It seems like a... perfect situation,

4612
05:29:51,126 --> 05:29:54,584
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

4613
05:29:54,663 --> 05:29:59,225
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not...

4614
05:29:59,301 --> 05:30:02,099
recover, uh, if I was...

4615
05:30:02,170 --> 05:30:06,231
once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

4616
05:30:06,308 --> 05:30:11,473
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

4617
05:30:11,546 --> 05:30:14,913
You'd go and I'd be, uh,

4618
05:30:14,983 --> 05:30:17,611
well, buggered, basically.

4619
05:30:19,121 --> 05:30:22,056
That really is a real no, isn't it?

4620
05:30:22,124 --> 05:30:26,823
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

4622
05:30:28,897 --> 05:30:32,628
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

4623
05:30:32,701 --> 05:30:34,635
Fine.

4624
05:30:36,505 --> 05:30:40,839
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

4625
05:30:44,546 --> 05:30:48,073
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know?

4626
05:30:51,887 --> 05:30:55,516
And don't forget I'm--

4627
05:30:55,590 --> 05:30:59,390
I'm also just a girl...

4628
05:30:59,461 --> 05:31:03,625
standing in front of a boy...

4629
05:31:03,699 --> 05:31:06,259
asking him to love her.

4630
05:31:17,145 --> 05:31:19,079
Good-bye.

4631
05:31:41,448 --> 05:31:43,882
So what do you think?
Good move?

4632
05:31:43,950 --> 05:31:46,248
[ Honey ]
Yeah, good move.

4633
05:31:46,319 --> 05:31:49,015
I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

4634
05:31:49,089 --> 05:31:51,023
I saw her taking her trousers down,

4635
05:31:51,091 --> 05:31:53,958
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

4636
05:31:54,027 --> 05:31:56,860
Good decision, yeah.

4637
05:31:56,930 --> 05:31:59,364
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

- Tones, what do you reckon?
- Never met her, never want to.

4639
05:32:02,569 --> 05:32:06,300
- Brilliant. Max?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

4640
05:32:06,373 --> 05:32:09,103
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

I was called and I came. What's up?

05:32:13,013 --> 05:32:15,174

No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

isn't the original, is it?

Um, you know,
I think it might be, yeah.

4647

But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

4648
05:32:40,774 --> 05:32:43,709
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.

anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it?

4652
05:33:00,594 --> 05:33:03,290
It was...

4653
05:33:03,363 --> 05:33:05,627
sort of... sweet, actually.

4654
05:33:05,699 --> 05:33:08,634
Um, I mean,
I know she's an actress and all that...

4655
05:33:08,702 --> 05:33:14,607
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

4656
05:33:14,674 --> 05:33:17,199
she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

4657
05:33:17,277 --> 05:33:20,144
but also that she was...

4658

the wrong decision, haven't I?

05:46:55,144 --> 05:47:00,741
I can't deny what I believe

4850
05:47:00,817 --> 05:47:04,275
I can't be what I'm not

4851
05:47:04,354 --> 05:47:09,553
- I know our love
- I know our love's forever

4852
05:47:09,625 --> 05:47:15,393
- I know
- I know no matter what

4853
05:47:16,632 --> 05:47:20,261
No matter who they follow

4854
05:47:21,771 --> 05:47:24,569
No matter where they've been

4855
05:47:26,909 --> 05:47:31,744
No matter how they judge us

4856
05:47:31,814 --> 05:47:36,649
I'll be everyone you need

4857
05:47:36,719 --> 05:47:42,316
- I can't deny what I believe
- What I believe

4858
05:47:42,392 --> 05:47:45,850
I can't be what I'm not

4859
05:47:45,928 --> 05:47:48,123
I know I'm not

4860
05:47:48,197 --> 05:47:52,691
I know this love's forever

4861
05:47:52,769 --> 05:48:00,403
That's all that matters now
no matter what

4862
05:48:01,911 --> 05:48:05,904
- No, no matter what
- No, no matter

4863
05:48:05,982 --> 05:48:08,917
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

4864
05:48:08,985 --> 05:48:11,317
No, no matter

4865
05:48:11,387 --> 05:48:14,049
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

4866
05:48:14,123 --> 05:48:16,455
No, no matter what

4867
05:48:16,526 --> 05:48:19,188
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

4868
05:48:19,262 --> 05:48:21,423
No, no matter what

4869
05:48:21,497 --> 05:48:24,489
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

4870
05:48:24,567 --> 05:48:26,797
No, no matter what

4871
05:48:26,869 --> 05:48:30,134
That's all that matters to me

4872
05:48:30,523 --> 05:48:34,051
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.

4873
05:48:35,128 --> 05:48:36,720
Right. Okay.

4874
05:48:36,797 --> 05:48:41,496
Tell me, if I employ a wet rag, would I
have to pay it as much as I pay you?

4875
05:48:45,672 --> 05:48:48,505
Hi.

4876
05:48:48,575 --> 05:48:50,668
Hello.

4877
05:48:50,744 --> 05:48:52,871
You disappeared.

4878
05:48:52,946 --> 05:48:55,574
Yeah. Yeah. Um--

4879
05:48:55,649 --> 05:48:59,517
I had to leave.
I didn't want to disturb.

4880
05:48:59,586 --> 05:49:03,579
- How have you been?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.

4881
05:49:03,657 --> 05:49:07,753
When they change the law,
Spike and I will marry immediately.

4882
05:49:07,828 --> 05:49:10,888
Whereas you, I've watched in wonder.

4883
05:49:10,964 --> 05:49:13,194
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.

4884
05:49:13,267 --> 05:49:16,703
It's-- It's all nonsense, believe me.

4885
05:49:16,770 --> 05:49:19,739
I'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...

4886
05:49:19,806 --> 05:49:21,740
nonsense it all is.

4887
05:49:23,911 --> 05:49:26,379
Well, um--

4888
05:49:26,446 --> 05:49:31,474
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... I'm leaving.

4889
05:49:33,620 --> 05:49:37,078
But, um--

4890
05:49:37,157 --> 05:49:40,786
I brought this for you from home,

4891
05:49:40,861 --> 05:49:43,091
so I thought I'd give it to you.

4892
05:49:44,531 --> 05:49:47,466
Thank you.

4893
05:49:47,534 --> 05:49:49,468
Shall I--

4894
05:49:49,536 --> 05:49:52,130
Oh, no, don't open it now.
I'll be embarrassed.

4895
05:49:54,975 --> 05:49:58,376
Well, thank you. I don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.

4896
05:49:58,445 --> 05:50:02,939
Actually, I had it in my apartment,
and I thought you'd--

4897
05:50:05,319 --> 05:50:08,117
But when it came to it,
I didn't know how to call,

4898
05:50:08,188 --> 05:50:11,282
having behaved so badly.

4899
05:50:11,358 --> 05:50:13,292
Twice.

4900
05:50:14,895 --> 05:50:19,059
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.

4901
05:50:19,132 --> 05:50:23,466
Then you came and... I figured--

4902
05:50:27,107 --> 05:50:29,473
The thing is--

4903
05:50:29,543 --> 05:50:31,477
The thing is--

4904
05:50:34,247 --> 05:50:37,148
What? What is the thing?

4905
05:50:38,385 --> 05:50:40,717
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.

4906
05:50:40,787 --> 05:50:43,449
- Go away.
- Right.

4907
05:50:43,523 --> 05:50:45,457
Sorry.

4908
05:50:47,728 --> 05:50:50,162
You were saying?

4909
05:50:52,666 --> 05:50:56,124
Yes.

4910
05:50:56,203 --> 05:50:59,036
I have to go away today, but I...

4911
05:50:59,106 --> 05:51:02,405
wondered if I didn't...

4912
05:51:02,476 --> 05:51:06,879
whether you might
let me see you a little,

4913
05:51:06,947 --> 05:51:09,814
or... a lot, maybe.

4914
05:51:13,086 --> 05:51:15,987
See if you could like me again.

4915
05:51:16,056 --> 05:51:18,490
But yesterday
that actor asked you who I was,

4916
05:51:18,558 --> 05:51:21,322
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.

4917
05:51:22,696 --> 05:51:25,790
I heard.

4918
05:51:25,866 --> 05:51:29,063
You had a microphone.
I had headphones.

4919
05:51:29,136 --> 05:51:31,127
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...

4920
05:51:31,204 --> 05:51:33,798
to the most indiscreet man
in England?

4921
05:51:35,242 --> 05:51:37,574
Uh, excuse me.

4922
05:51:37,644 --> 05:51:40,078
It's your mother on the phone.

4923
05:51:42,849 --> 05:51:44,976
Will you tell her
I'll ring her back?

4924
05:51:45,052 --> 05:51:48,146
I've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,

4925
05:51:48,221 --> 05:51:50,189
and it's now been about 24 hours...

4926
05:51:50,257 --> 05:51:53,693
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in color and--

4927
05:51:53,760 --> 05:51:57,526
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.

4928
05:51:59,700 --> 05:52:02,498
Martin, hold the fort a second.

4929
05:52:02,569 --> 05:52:04,935
Uh, yes. All right.

4930
05:52:10,077 --> 05:52:12,602
Um, could I just say--

4931
05:52:12,679 --> 05:52:17,742
[ Chuckles ] I thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.

4932
05:52:18,985 --> 05:52:21,647
- Is that right?
- Oh, yes.

4933
05:52:21,722 --> 05:52:24,782
[ Chuckles ]

4934
05:52:24,858 --> 05:52:28,760
Um, I've always wondered...

4935
05:52:28,829 --> 05:52:32,026
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.

4936
05:52:32,099 --> 05:52:35,762
I can't say that I know Patrick
all that well.

4937
05:52:35,836 --> 05:52:38,100
He wasn't that friendly during filming?

4938
05:52:38,171 --> 05:52:43,609
Well, I'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.

4939
05:52:46,079 --> 05:52:48,445
Oh. Oh, right.

4940
05:52:48,515 --> 05:52:50,449
Sorry.
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

4941
05:52:52,085 --> 05:52:55,350
Always been a bit of an ass.
[ Chuckling ]

4942
05:52:55,422 --> 05:52:58,391
Um, anyway-- Um--

4943
05:52:58,458 --> 05:53:00,392
Well, it was lovely to meet you.

4944
05:53:00,460 --> 05:53:02,894
I'm a huge, huge fan of yours.

4945
05:53:02,963 --> 05:53:06,592
And Demi's, of course.

4946
05:53:09,102 --> 05:53:11,332
Sorry.

4947
05:53:11,404 --> 05:53:13,269
That's fine.

4948
05:53:13,340 --> 05:53:17,140
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.

4949
05:53:19,412 --> 05:53:22,575
Anna, look, um--

4950
05:53:22,649 --> 05:53:26,449
I'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,

4951
05:53:26,520 --> 05:53:30,388
not often in and out of love.

4952
05:53:30,457 --> 05:53:32,584
But, uh--

4953
05:53:37,130 --> 05:53:39,530
Can I just say no to your...

4954
05:53:39,599 --> 05:53:43,933
kind request and, uh, leave it at that?

4955
05:53:47,340 --> 05:53:50,673
Yes.

4956
05:53:50,744 --> 05:53:54,271
Fine. Of course. I--

4957
05:53:54,347 --> 05:53:56,406
Of course.

4958
05:53:58,118 --> 05:54:01,178
I'll just be going, then.
It was nice to see you.

4959
05:54:01,254 --> 05:54:04,189
The thing is,

4960
05:54:04,257 --> 05:54:07,715
with you I'm in real... danger.

4961
05:54:07,794 --> 05:54:10,991
It seems like a... perfect situation,

4962
05:54:11,064 --> 05:54:14,522
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...

4963
05:54:14,601 --> 05:54:19,163
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, I fear, not...

4964
05:54:19,239 --> 05:54:22,037
recover, uh, if I was...

4965
05:54:22,108 --> 05:54:26,169
once again cast aside,
as I would absolutely expect to be.

4966
05:54:26,246 --> 05:54:31,411
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.

4967
05:54:31,484 --> 05:54:34,851
You'd go and I'd be, uh,

4968
05:54:34,921 --> 05:54:37,549
well, buggered, basically.

4969
05:54:39,059 --> 05:54:41,994
That really is a real no, isn't it?

4970
05:54:42,062 --> 05:54:46,761
I live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.

4971
05:54:46,833 --> 05:54:48,767
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.

4972
05:54:48,835 --> 05:54:52,566
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.

4973
05:54:52,639 --> 05:54:54,573
Fine.

4974
05:54:56,443 --> 05:55:00,777
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.

4975
05:55:04,484 --> 05:55:08,011
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know?

4976
05:55:11,825 --> 05:55:15,454
And don't forget I'm--

4977
05:55:15,528 --> 05:55:19,328
I'm also just a girl...

4978
05:55:19,399 --> 05:55:23,563
standing in front of a boy...

4979
05:55:23,637 --> 05:55:26,197
asking him to love her.

4980
05:55:37,083 --> 05:55:39,017
Good-bye.

4981
05:56:01,386 --> 05:56:03,820
So what do you think?
Good move?

4982
05:56:03,888 --> 05:56:06,186
[ Honey ]
Yeah, good move.

4983
05:56:06,257 --> 05:56:08,953
I mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.

4984
05:56:09,027 --> 05:56:10,961
I saw her taking her trousers down,

4985
05:56:11,029 --> 05:56:13,896
and I definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.

4986
05:56:13,965 --> 05:56:16,798
Good decision, yeah.

4987
05:56:16,868 --> 05:56:19,302
All actresses are as mad as snakes.

4988
05:56:19,371 --> 05:56:22,431
- Tones, what do you reckon?
- Never met her, never want to.

4989
05:56:22,507 --> 05:56:26,238
- Brilliant. Max?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.

4990
05:56:26,311 --> 05:56:29,041
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.

4991
05:56:30,348 --> 05:56:32,873
[ Panting ]
I was called and I came. What's up?

4992
05:56:32,951 --> 05:56:35,112
William's just turned down Anna Scott.

4993
05:56:36,755 --> 05:56:39,656
You daft prick.

4994
05:56:39,724 --> 05:56:43,125
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.

4995
05:56:46,464 --> 05:56:50,230
That painting
isn't the original, is it?

4996
05:56:50,301 --> 05:56:52,895
Um, you know,
I think it might be, yeah.

4997
05:56:55,807 --> 05:56:58,173
But she said
she wanted to go out with you.

4998
05:57:00,712 --> 05:57:03,647
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.

4999
05:57:05,216 --> 05:57:08,310
What?

5000
05:57:08,386 --> 05:57:10,547
Well, you know,

5001
05:57:10,622 --> 05:57:14,752
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it?

5002
05:57:20,532 --> 05:57:23,228
It was...

5003
05:57:23,301 --> 05:57:25,565
sort of... sweet, actually.

5004
05:57:25,637 --> 05:57:28,572
Um, I mean,
I know she's an actress and all that...

5005
05:57:28,640 --> 05:57:34,545
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,

5006
05:57:34,612 --> 05:57:37,137
she said she might be
as famous as she can be,

5007
05:57:37,215 --> 05:57:40,082
but also that she was...

5008
05:57:40,151 --> 05:57:43,484
just a girl...

5009
05:57:43,555 --> 05:57:47,924
standing in front of a boy...

5010
05:57:47,992 --> 05:57:50,460
asking him... to love her.

5011
05:58:05,577 --> 05:58:09,013
Oh, sod a dog. I've made
the wrong decision, haven't I?

5012
05:58:11,049 --> 05:58:12,914
Yeah.

5013
05:58:12,984 --> 05:58:15,919
Max, how fast is your car?

5014
05:58:16,254 --> 05:58:19,553
- Hey
- [ Horn Honks ]

5015
05:58:19,624 --> 05:58:23,424
- Good luck!
- If anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.

5016
05:58:23,495 --> 05:58:25,360
- Where to?
- All I can think is The Ritz.

5017
05:58:25,430 --> 05:58:28,024
- Where's Bella?
- She's not coming.

5018
05:58:28,099 --> 05:58:31,296
- Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.

06:09:58,439 --> 06:10:01,738
Like no one before you

5188
06:10:01,809 --> 06:10:06,576
I love you just the way you are

5189
06:10:06,647 --> 06:10:11,209
It's in the way you want me

5190
06:10:13,154 --> 06:10:18,524
Oh, it's in the way you hold me

5191
06:10:20,761 --> 06:10:25,664
The way you show me
just what love's

5192
06:10:25,733 --> 06:10:27,963
Made of

5193
06:10:28,035 --> 06:10:33,735
It's in the way we make love

5194
06:10:35,409 --> 06:10:42,178
It's just the way you are

5195
06:10:54,729 --> 06:10:59,826
No matter what they tell us

5196
06:10:59,900 --> 06:11:03,097
No matter what they do

5197
06:11:05,072 --> 06:11:09,304
No matter what they teach us

5198
06:11:10,311 --> 06:11:13,610
What we believe is true

5199
06:11:15,082 --> 06:11:20,679
I can't deny what I believe

5200
06:11:20,755 --> 06:11:24,213
I can't be what I'm not

5201
06:11:24,292 --> 06:11:29,491
- I know our love
- I know our love's forever

5202
06:11:29,563 --> 06:11:35,331
- I know
- I know no matter what

5203
06:11:36,570 --> 06:11:40,199
No matter who they follow

5204
06:11:41,709 --> 06:11:44,507
No matter where they've been

5205
06:11:46,847 --> 06:11:51,682
No matter how they judge us

5206
06:11:51,752 --> 06:11:56,587
I'll be everyone you need

5207
06:11:56,657 --> 06:12:02,254
- I can't deny what I believe
- What I believe

5208
06:12:02,330 --> 06:12:05,788
I can't be what I'm not

5209
06:12:05,866 --> 06:12:08,061
I know I'm not

5210
06:12:08,135 --> 06:12:12,629
I know this love's forever

5211
06:12:12,707 --> 06:12:20,341
That's all that matters now
no matter what

5212
06:12:21,849 --> 06:12:25,842
- No, no matter what
- No, no matter

5213
06:12:25,920 --> 06:12:28,855
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

5214
06:12:28,923 --> 06:12:31,255
No, no matter

5215
06:12:31,325 --> 06:12:33,987
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

5216
06:12:34,061 --> 06:12:36,393
No, no matter what

5217
06:12:36,464 --> 06:12:39,126
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

5218
06:12:39,200 --> 06:12:41,361
No, no matter what

5219
06:12:41,435 --> 06:12:44,427
- That's all that matters to me
- No, no matter what

5220
06:12:44,505 --> 06:12:46,735
No, no matter what

5221
06:12:46,807 --> 06:12:50,072
That's all that matters to me
