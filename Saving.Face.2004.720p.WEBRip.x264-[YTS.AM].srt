1
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,657
You were right, Winston.
Kid's got the touch.

2
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,192
Reminds me a little of you.

3
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,369
Think she'll be chief of surgery
when she's 55?

4
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,830
When she's 40.

5
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,939
Suture, please.

6
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,244
She got a sweetheart yet?

7
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:32,548
No time to date.
The hospital keeps her too busy.

8
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,013
She was always first in her class.
Not like my lazy Raymond.

9
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,919
He never opens a book,
only his wallet.

10
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:43,890
At 29, he's already VP of his company.
What are you complaining about?

11
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:49,126
Yeah, money seems to cling to him,
but what's the use?

12
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,600
He's only 5'8".

13
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,234
Let me tell you...

14
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,572
...every Friday, Wilhelmina
comes home for the dance.

15
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,681
Good. See you there tonight.

16
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:06,944
Be discrete. Nothing kills romance
faster than a mother's approval.

17
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:08,781
Have faith, I know what to do.

18
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:12,322
And make sure his hands are clean.
It's flu season.

19
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,017
I'll wash them myself if I have to.

20
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,958
Okay, bye-bye.

21
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:35,080
You're late again.

22
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:39,111
- All the crab is gone.
- This party's a bust. Let's go to KFC.

23
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,220
Cheeky girl.

24
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,423
So thin. You'll catch your death.

25
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:50,056
I see men's clothes
are still in style.

26
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,897
Let me button that for you.
People are going to think....

27
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,735
Hey.

28
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,877
Raymond!

29
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,777
- Give me that!
- Mother.

30
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,321
Wil, I love your outfit!

31
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't you think it's too boyish?

32
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,560
Nonsense.

33
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,797
I had a pair just like those
during the Revolution.

34
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,196
Sturdy and practical.
Just the thing for war.

35
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,531
Your high heels on the other hand....

36
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,106
Those things will kill you.

37
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:38,142
It'll be a miracle
if you don't trip and die.

38
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,210
I'm going to get some squid.

39
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,276
Hey, Grandma.

40
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,247
How about it, Wil?
Do me the honor?

41
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,450
Good to see you, Old Yu.

42
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,924
How much did your mom bribe you
to come over here?

43
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,064
So who's the unlucky fellow
this week?

44
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,201
I'm not sure, but I think it's shorty,
next to the punch bowl.

45
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,665
Butch.

46
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,966
- How can you tell?
- Call it a hunch.

47
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,674
- I think he's some sort of stock whiz.
- Does he have stock in Rogaine?

48
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,677
I'm glad you weren't this snarky
before our setup.

49
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,381
What?

50
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,717
Okay, out with it.

51
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,512
My mother gave me 20 bucks
to dance with you.

52
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:23,690
Yeah, well, you dance like a girl.

53
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,088
Let me say a few words.

54
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:34,060
As the lazy toads
of summer give way...

55
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,632
...to the crackling
of autumn leaves...

56
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:42,405
...one's mind naturally turns toward
the demise of our children's education.

57
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:24,614
I give thanks to the woman
who has suffered alongside me.

58
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:30,482
- I toast you.
- Okay, no more suffering. Let's eat.

59
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,000
Here we go. Signal if you need me.

60
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:43,530
- Raymond.
- Wil.

61
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,432
Shall we?

62
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,332
So, what do you do, Raymond?

63
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,034
Well, I do some short selling
on Wall Street. It's a pretty sweet job.

64
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,615
Look at those two.

65
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,716
Don't their faces
reflect good marriage chi?

66
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,352
Depends on whose marriage.

67
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,880
Hey, Albert!
Don't eat too much of that cabbage.

68
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,082
It gives you gas!

69
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,853
So I said, "Listen, fuck-wad,
you early terminate this."

70
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,586
Then I slammed down the phone.

71
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,631
Now I'm on Verizon's national
single-rate plan.

72
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,597
Your Raymond is such a gentleman.

73
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:19,068
Anyone looks good on his arm.

74
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:23,267
With free mobile-to-mobile
and unlimited nights and weekends.

75
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,172
- I'm sorry.
- Hey there. May we cut?

76
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,641
- Yes.
- Yes.

77
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:30,283
Six minutes.
I believe that's a new record.

78
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:36,014
That's my cousin, Vivian.
Big deal ballerina with City Ballet.

79
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,323
Are you into dancers?

80
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,459
Me? No.

81
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,491
Another great party.

82
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,659
My husband and I fought
all the way over here.

83
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,365
But I'm having a great time.
Is there more wine?

84
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,136
You are so into her.

85
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,539
I am not into her.

86
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:02,010
- That was convincing.
- Shut up.

87
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,016
Poor Jenny.

88
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:09,421
They say her ex-husband has a
new wife 20 years younger than her.

89
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,624
Serves her right.
He made good money.

90
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,054
What's to be unhappy about?

91
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,488
Marry a rooster, follow the rooster.
Marry a dog, follow the dog.

92
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,191
Why be like those Americans,
divorcing all the time?

93
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,166
She'll never marry again.
Women never do.

94
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,034
She's certainly not meeting
anyone here.

95
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,800
Still...

96
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,672
...must be lonely at these parties
without a man.

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,077
What do you think those morons
talk about anyway?

98
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,911
The usual ball scratching.

99
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,653
They say he's got a new wife
on the Upper East Side.

100
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,356
I heard she's 20 years younger.

101
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:49,859
My back hurts just thinking about it.

102
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,395
I plan to be married soon myself.

103
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:54,565
Anyone in mind?

104
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,402
Good luck. You'll have to get
past her father first.

105
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,072
- May I cut?
- Sure, Mr. Cho. Nice suit.

106
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:11,115
Thank you. Hi. Is he your boyfriend?

107
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,047
Just plain friends.

108
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,414
He not enough good for you anyway.

109
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,419
I heard that.

110
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,091
You don't want to wait too long.

111
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,286
Forget meat on the grill,
and it will dry out.

112
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:26,933
- Right. So my ma says.
- Does she?

113
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,102
She's quite a woman.

114
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:34,673
Ever since your father passed away,
she's been so delicate.

115
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:38,641
These 20-odd years
you've been all she has.

116
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:40,437
Wilhelmina!

117
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,311
Yeah. She's delicate.

118
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:45,712
Good to see you.

119
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,181
I'm not feeling so well.
Take me home.

120
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:55,886
It's those heels, I tell you!

121
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,273
Thanks, Little Yu.

122
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,175
Home to see your grandparents?

123
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,179
The weekly pilgrimage
to Flushing...

124
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,150
- ...to swim in the Chinese gene pool.
- Good girl.

125
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,982
How come you never have to go?

126
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,680
I have station duty Friday nights.

127
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:26,688
Lucky.

128
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:29,085
From my father.

129
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,854
He still telling fortunes?

130
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,524
As long as there are anxious wives
and mothers, he'll be in business.

131
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,363
What's this?

132
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,768
Your mother asked him
to give you some herbs...

133
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,238
...to improve your fortitude
for marriage.

134
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,411
You've got to be kidding.

135
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:48,513
It's all natural, no side effects.

136
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,444
- There's my train.
- Hey!

137
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,882
Give it a try. Those herbs
are good for your heart anyway.

138
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,558
Go talk to him,
see if we can get the court.

139
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,293
I ain't gonna talk to him.
You go talk to him.

140
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:16,037
Why don't he go play some
Chinese checkers or something? Shit.

141
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:21,371
Professor, your chi is so potent...

142
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,812
...you've managed to hold
the court once again.

143
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:29,720
No fortunes to tell this morning,
Old Yu?

144
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,381
Most people don't want to hear
the truth until after lunch.

145
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:40,065
Fate is for the lazy.

146
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,931
Too true, too true.

147
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:46,367
But I won't lie,
my only morning customer...

148
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,235
...was your only daughter.

149
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:50,808
Her?

150
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,002
What does she have to worry about?

151
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,613
She lives safely at home with us.

152
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,812
Her daughter's a doctor.

153
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,816
- What more could she want?
- lndeed.

154
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:05,390
But her health may be a bit bumpy
this year.

155
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,219
Ridiculous. She's only 48.

156
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,920
Could be menopause.

157
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,991
Menopause?

158
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:17,068
Nonsense.

159
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,034
Only Americans freak out
about menopause.

160
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,971
The whole relationship is adolescent.
He tells me on the phone...

161
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,873
- ...that he wants to break up.
- Again?

162
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,106
And that's not the worst of it.
I was assisting Morgan then...

163
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,081
...so it was over the speakerphone
for all the team to hear.

164
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,050
You know what the sickest thing was?
All I could think of...

165
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,884
...was having the bed to myself,
catching up on sleep.

166
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,390
Game of survival, sleep trumps sex.

167
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,155
You know who I saw
yesterday at the Fulton clinic?

168
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,956
Your mom.

169
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,531
- My mom?
- I waved but she didn't see me.

170
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,898
You sure it was her?
You met her once.

171
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,664
Oh, she's pretty memorable.

172
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,201
No. She never leaves Flushing.

173
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,324
No change?

174
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,871
So...

175
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,575
...are you sick?

176
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,077
No.

177
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,213
I'm here visiting my father.

178
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,678
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,853
- ls he sick?
- You could say that.

180
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,460
He's-- He's sort of dead
to the world.

181
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,060
- Here.
- No.

182
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,201
- No, I'm-- I'm--
- Really. Really. Take it.

183
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,784
Is that what you're gonna eat?

184
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,981
Yeah.

185
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,694
You really should eat better.

186
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,998
How about this one?

187
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,664
It's packed with peanuts.

188
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,837
And a lot of other
satisfying carcinogens.

189
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,006
Sometimes your body
knows what you really want.

190
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,144
See you around.

191
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,374
Ma?

192
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,375
Thank God you're here!
I've been waiting for hours.

193
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,774
What are you doing here?

194
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,711
This is a crummy neighborhood.

195
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,681
Take this.

196
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,413
Oh, my God! Are you sick?

197
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,989
Do I look sick to you?

198
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,587
Pick up that bag.

199
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:29,989
Did Wai Po's heart give out?

200
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:34,756
Don't be ridiculous.
She'll outlive us all.

201
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,395
Are you crying?

202
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:37,729
Do I look like I'm crying?

203
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,498
I can't tell.
You're wearing those sunglasses.

204
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,543
Ma, what are you doing here?

205
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,008
You're just going to let me
freeze to death here?

206
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,723
Ma.

207
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,826
Ma!

208
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,903
Tell me what happened.

209
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,600
Ma!

210
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,367
All right. I'm calling Grandma.

211
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:22,878
Is that how you speak to your ma
who worked nights so you could eat?

212
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,983
Who stayed in labor
without painkillers...

213
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,881
...so you wouldn't turn dim-witted
like your cousin Jimmy?

214
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:31,683
Had I known
you would grow so ungrateful...

215
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,052
...I would have held you in.

216
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,061
Has she eaten?

217
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,559
What is she doing here?

218
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,564
She'll need better nutrition now.

219
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:43,997
She's not that old.

220
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,604
One night without Chinese food
isn't gonna kill her.

221
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,001
Wait, I can't hear. Ma.

222
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,074
Can you pipe down?

223
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,742
It's good for her to stay with you.
You're a doctor.

224
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:56,176
You can help her...

225
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:58,374
...maybe get free drugs
from the hospital.

226
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,278
Can you please...?

227
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,385
- Okay.
- You'll pick up her things tomorrow.

228
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,754
- I'll bring her back tomorrow.
- I'll prepare herbs from Old Yu.

229
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,952
They'll help her with the baby.

230
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,093
Baby?

231
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,300
- Pregnant!
- At her age!

232
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,134
- It's a scandal!
- A disgrace!

233
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,539
- It's better than the soaps!
- More drama!

234
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,838
- More intrigue!
- More eel!

235
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,017
Don't eat so much eel!
It gives you gas.

236
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,409
Who's the father?

237
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,519
Who is the father?

238
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,924
- Father.
- Don't call me Father!

239
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,617
You are the biggest disgrace,
the ultimate shame.

240
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,161
What kind of example are you
for your daughter?

241
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:49,165
- You're not pregnant too are you?
- Me? No. No.

242
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:53,467
No daughter has shamed her parents
more than you.

243
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,006
What have we done
to deserve this?

244
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,974
Do you have any idea
who the father is?

245
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,671
Can't bring it up.

246
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,779
She just cries and goes on
about how ungrateful I am.

247
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,385
How did you find out she was...?

248
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,285
The receptionist
at the Manhattan clinic...

249
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,824
...is married to one
of Grandpa's former students.

250
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,198
One billion Chinese people,
two degrees of separation.

251
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:23,132
He's going to banish her
from Flushing. Where will she go?

252
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,831
He can't do this to her.
She belongs here.

253
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,209
Who is the father?

254
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,142
You won't tell us? Fine.

255
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,248
Take all the ones
with your mother in them.

256
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,287
She is no longer
a part of this family.

257
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,686
Father. Don't be like this.

258
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:51,990
When I think of all we've sacrificed
in the old country...

259
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:57,300
...to give you kids a better life
in the new one.

260
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:02,669
Had I known, I would have left you
behind in the mainland.

261
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,308
Father, please don't feel shamed.

262
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,412
How can I not feel shame?

263
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:11,710
My own rotten flesh has gotten
pregnant without a husband.

264
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:16,416
You don't think people
will laugh at me?

265
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,421
The professor speaks big words...

266
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:22,390
...but can't control his own daughter?

267
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:25,029
Old man, this situation won't improve
with yelling.

268
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,664
She wasn't even going to tell us.

269
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:30,563
She can throw her own reputation
away, but it still comes back to me.

270
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,933
Still crying?

271
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,540
Get out of this house.

272
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:43,611
Don't come back until you have
a husband to match the child.

273
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,824
How long?

274
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,193
Who knows?

275
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,733
Till my grandfather takes her back in,
I guess.

276
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:06,537
- When's that gonna happen?
- When she gets married...

277
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,435
...or proves immaculate conception.

278
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,934
Inspiring prospects.

279
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:21,043
Look how cheerful this red is.
We'll put some up here...

280
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,222
...there and there!

281
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,290
That black is just depressing.

282
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,189
You have no oyster sauce.

283
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,227
I don't use oyster sauce.

284
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,627
Since when do you drink beer?

285
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,903
Can we just...?

286
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,704
Who's the...? The....

287
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,372
How long do you plan on--?

288
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,810
You shouldn't keep this stuff
unless you plan to use it.

289
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,616
Do you plan to keep the...?

290
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,014
What kind of vegetable is this?

291
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:05,188
I see you just let my face masks
waste away.

292
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,366
- What's this?
- Herbs from Old Yu.

293
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:11,935
Every week, he has his son
Little Yu give them to me...

294
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,231
...to improve my marriage chi
or something.

295
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,998
I don't know why he bothers.

296
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,177
Don't be rude,
just hiding them here.

297
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,142
I want to have a look.

298
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,979
Why can't she get
her own apartment?

299
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,449
Are you insane? Do you know
what kind of karmic hell...

300
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:32,091
...I'd pay as a Chinese daughter
who didn't take in her own mom?

301
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,261
No, the woman
could never live alone.

302
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,257
"Pull this knob"?

303
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:54,711
Wow, I only ever see you smile
like that during surgery.

304
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,049
- Please don't hold the door....
- Two?

305
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:06,521
The big one is for your mother.
Morning sickness.

306
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,048
Ma?

307
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,947
You're home.

308
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,179
Turn up the TV.

309
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,290
It's just getting to the good part.

310
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,289
She's dumping him.

311
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,363
What is that smell?

312
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,867
Smells great, right? Stinky tofu.

313
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:54,639
We'll never get the stench
out of here.

314
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,867
Is that what's for dinner?

315
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,704
No, that's just a special treat.

316
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,006
We have chicken, sweet pea stalks,
and fish with bean sauce.

317
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,377
Great. Jay loves fish.

318
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:07,547
Is he coming?

319
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,421
Ma, you can't give him a paper plate.

320
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,320
Safer this way.
Throw it out afterwards.

321
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,755
It's rude.

322
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,896
I'll give him two.

323
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,196
His shoes! His shoes!

324
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,702
Hi, Mrs. Pang.

325
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,431
You remember my neighbor, Jay.

326
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,836
His shoes!

327
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:34,179
You don't have to talk so loud.
And leave your shoes by the door.

328
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,122
So I get a call from....

329
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,884
Your neighbor is loud and dark
and eats too much soy sauce.

330
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:17,549
Americans like soy sauce.

331
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,529
I'm going to start eating less
soy sauce...

332
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,595
...so it won't stain the baby too dark.

333
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,596
Ma, that's ridiculous.

334
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,968
You eat less too,
so you don't grow spots.

335
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,969
Thanks.

336
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,433
Too late for him anyway.

337
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,571
Let's keep her.

338
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,120
- So good.
- Thank you.

339
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,589
Thank you for coming.
So, what did you guys think?

340
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:58,890
You were wonderful. So, so fantastic.

341
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,599
- Bye.
- I'll see you.

342
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,809
- Bye.
- You did a great job.

343
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,750
Where to now, doctor?

344
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:58,089
- My dad used to come here.
- Mine too.

345
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:00,555
This one he'd wear.

346
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:02,556
What does he do?

347
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,753
Judge me, fail me.

348
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,164
I can't tell you how pissed
he was when I wasn't promoted...

349
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,267
...to principal this season.

350
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:15,065
And now he's just praying I'll get
that gig with the Paris Opera Ballet.

351
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,801
Paris? Wow. Sounds impressive.

352
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,513
Gives him something to hope for.

353
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,977
He must be proud of this new show.

354
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,947
He thinks modern dance
was created by...

355
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,121
...a bunch of wild-haired
hippie dropouts.

356
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,824
Yeah, there were some
freaky moments.

357
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,558
But on the whole it was....

358
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:40,288
I'm sure if he just saw the show.

359
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,697
Maybe you could tell him.

360
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,734
He's your boss.

361
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:58,306
Relax. He's too consumed
by his own life...

362
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,452
...to pay any attention to mine...

363
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:05,313
...as long as he can trot out
his daughter, the prima ballerina.

364
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,925
The modern gig is just for fun
while I'm on sabbatical.

365
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,430
I kind of love it, but....
Yeah, whatever.

366
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,461
Maybe he's right. Most girls
would kill for my spot at City...

367
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:23,574
...and here I am
trying to express myself.

368
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,306
I should chuck the distractions...

369
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,708
...focus on being a bunhead.

370
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,145
That would really suck.

371
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,222
So...

372
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,861
...how come we never met
before now?

373
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:48,561
We did meet. Nineteen years ago.

374
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:51,333
I was 8, you were 9.

375
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,266
Outside the temple.

376
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:55,403
I don't remember.

377
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59,670
The Wong boys were taunting me
about my parents' divorce.

378
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,875
You beat the crap out of them.

379
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:08,609
You were wearing
a Kristy McNichol T-shirt...

380
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,881
...tan cords and a pageboy.

381
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:16,588
You spilled your mom's groceries.
We scooped them into a bag.

382
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:19,492
That's right, and then....

383
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,368
And then I kissed you on the nose.

384
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:27,901
And you ran.

385
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,733
Excuse me.
Do you have Chinese movies?

386
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,439
China.

387
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:08,501
My view.

388
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,205
It's nice.

389
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,445
I teach down at Arts Alliance.

390
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:28,049
- You like kids?
- No. City Ballet outreach.

391
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:31,755
I'm teaching them how to fall
without hurting themselves.

392
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,228
I'll show you. Here.

393
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,309
Try it.

394
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,486
- No, no, no, really.
- Relax.

395
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:04,729
Okay, when I say "fall,"
you totally let go.

396
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,420
Okay?

397
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,860
Fall.

398
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,536
Fall.

399
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,364
Okay, fall!

400
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,673
Sorry. I can't do this.

401
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,863
That's it. You got it.

402
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,959
- You okay?
- That was good.

403
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,796
That was....

404
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,640
That was...

405
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,970
...fun.

406
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,324
Oh, my God.

407
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:44,086
Yeah, don't stop.

408
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,268
Who's your Asian daddy?

409
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:12,051
I like the sound of the ball
going into the hole.

410
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,715
Hi, folks, I'm Fuzzy Zoeller
for the Putting Peg and Pod.

411
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:18,419
You know, in this great big game
of golf today...

412
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,495
...everybody's looking
for more yardage...

413
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:24,669
...and the best-kept secret is making
those three- and four-footers.

414
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:28,173
Have you eaten?

415
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,116
How long have you been pregnant?

416
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,299
A couple of months.

417
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:04,999
Married?

418
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,197
Once.

419
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,678
Children are a blessing
just the same.

420
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:18,311
Number 48.

421
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,422
- We need to see the patient alone.
- I'll be right here.

422
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,260
- lsn't it dangerous?
- Not necessarily.

423
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,058
We would monitor her more closely.

424
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,293
I didn't think it was possible.
I read those TIME magazine articles.

425
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:41,371
I can literally feel my eggs atrophy.

426
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:45,532
It's easier to conceive later
if you've had a child before.

427
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,879
She must have all sorts
of weird cravings.

428
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,549
She's at home
clawing the cupboards.

429
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,877
So she's having the kid?

430
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,781
Don't know.

431
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,780
Who's the father?

432
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,349
She won't say.

433
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:08,890
These are good for someone
who's cooped up and depressed.

434
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:13,098
I had to shop for my mom
after the divorce.

435
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:18,273
She wouldn't leave the house, totally
ostracized by those Chinese biddies.

436
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,211
I vowed to get out of Flushing
as soon as I could.

437
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,949
Why didn't your mom get out?

438
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:27,980
Where would she go?

439
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,681
Thirsty?

440
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:47,829
Don't forget. I invited
the mahjong ladies over tonight.

441
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,239
I haven't forgotten.

442
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,638
So don't bring
any of your friends over.

443
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:57,611
I won't even be home till late.
It's a co-worker's birthday.

444
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,546
You should get home in time
to say hello to them.

445
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,913
You haven't seen them in so long.

446
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,153
Throw it here.

447
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,465
Hey, birthday girl.

448
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,006
Do I get a birthday kiss?

449
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,581
Saved by the fence.

450
00:37:36,555 --> 00:37:38,216
Where were you last night?

451
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,286
Mom was waiting for me again.

452
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:46,821
I'll definitely be there tonight.

453
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:50,230
"Definitely" definitely,
or "definitely" maybe?

454
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:53,097
You know, my friends
are starting to think you don't exist.

455
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:57,264
Trust me.
I'll definitely, definitely be there.

456
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,340
- Six surgeries?
- Goddamn sick people.

457
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,879
It's just that I promised Vivian
I'd meet her friends tonight.

458
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,018
You're meeting the friends?
Prepare to be grilled.

459
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:15,585
Vivian, we had some emergencies.
I can't get out of here until 8.

460
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,864
Make that 9.

461
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,339
Have the most expensive
birthday floral arrangement...

462
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,099
...delivered to this address.

463
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,902
Ten. Ten.

464
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:51,756
Wil, last minute preop.
I have to run. Can you take it?

465
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,205
Everyone's gone home.

466
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,572
Can I come in?

467
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:12,581
I'm not sure.

468
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,085
Okay.

469
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:25,854
That's it?

470
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,733
You didn't want me to stay.

471
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,735
I didn't say you should leave.

472
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,006
Never mind.

473
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:53,447
That one's from you.
That one's from my dad.

474
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,595
I'm an idiot.

475
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:04,864
What if I stay the night?

476
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,098
The whole night?

477
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,109
The whole night.

478
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,848
Happy birthday.

479
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,934
Hello, Vivian?

480
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,661
This is your mother.

481
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,169
Just calling to say hi.

482
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,965
Hope your birthday good.

483
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,665
Did Wil show up?

484
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:21,778
Thought you may wanna talk
after she leaves.

485
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,141
Oh, maybe she's still there?

486
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,045
Okay. Bye.

487
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,777
Oh, my God.

488
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,754
You talked to your mother about us?

489
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,361
Yeah. So?

490
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,496
"So"? Does she know we have sex?

491
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:46,268
No, Wil.
She thinks we conjugate Latin verbs.

492
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:48,204
Really?

493
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,142
Did you tell her about this?

494
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,618
You missed the mahjong party.

495
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,380
Ma, don't start with me today.

496
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,650
You wanna bust on someone,
find yourself a husband to bust on.

497
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,457
So marry her off. There's gotta be
someone you can fix her up with.

498
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,034
I'll put the word out.
We'll come up with someone.

499
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:22,297
Oh, hey, my landlord's a Chinese guy.

500
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:23,906
- No wife?
- I don't think so.

501
00:42:24,109 --> 00:42:27,442
- He's not very chatty, but he's rich.
- Might as well put him on the list.

502
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,910
What about Mr. Park
over at Smiler's Deli?

503
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,881
- Park is Korean. Ma's strictly Chinese.
- Your mom called.

504
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,780
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's a Mr. Fu.

505
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,818
He's finishing a checkup
with Morgan.

506
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,320
Let me see his stats.

507
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,418
Fifty-three, unmarried.

508
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:47,189
Thyroid levels aren't where I'd like
to see them, but overall pretty healthy.

509
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:50,368
Okay. Be discrete
but ask him if he's free Friday.

510
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:52,197
Book him, Danno.

511
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:53,662
I'm not going on a date.

512
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:54,839
Let your hair down.

513
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,305
Too puffy, better up.
But I'm not going.

514
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,343
Is that what you're gonna wear?

515
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,103
What's wrong with it?

516
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,179
Maybe you should
wear something brighter.

517
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:07,015
How about this one?

518
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:10,654
Chinese people cannot wear yellow.

519
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,321
On sale.

520
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:22,465
How about this one? It's sexy.

521
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,227
No one wants to see a 50-year-old
Chinese woman look sexy.

522
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,800
Ma, you're only 48.

523
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,299
Connie Chung's sexy,
and she must be nearly 60.

524
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:33,636
Her show was cancelled.

525
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,812
- ls it a white guy?
- No.

526
00:43:40,018 --> 00:43:41,679
An ugly old white guy.

527
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,478
No. He's Chinese.

528
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:48,652
He's nice, very healthy.

529
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,589
Pretty healthy.

530
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:54,955
I'm not going.

531
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:00,161
Okay. Okay. Wear that.

532
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:02,465
I'm really not going.

533
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:03,902
It'll be fun.

534
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:05,701
Then you go.

535
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,576
All right, forget it.

536
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,952
Forget it. It's already 10 till 7.

537
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,950
I don't have enough time.

538
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:26,288
Tell him I'm sick.

539
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,831
Lost my voice.

540
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:33,562
What am I going
to talk about anyway?

541
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,808
Forty-eight and going on a date.

542
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:47,678
Ma.

543
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,151
It's okay.

544
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,154
We have enough time.

545
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:59,558
Look. This dress isn't bad.

546
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,566
We'll just take your hair down.

547
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:11,771
What?

548
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,778
What are you looking at?

549
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:16,771
Ma...

550
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,509
...you're beautiful.

551
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,648
Do I tell him about the baby?

552
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,551
Save it for the second date.

553
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,960
So, Mr. Fu,
what is your line of work?

554
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:41,638
I'm in import-export.

555
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,671
- Good business?
- Not bad, not bad.

556
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,469
Made enough last month
to go on a singles cruise to Fiji.

557
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:54,012
Not that I went.

558
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,649
- You're an only daughter?
- Yes.

559
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:03,123
I always wish I had kids.

560
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,562
No kids? Do you want any?

561
00:46:06,965 --> 00:46:11,459
No, it's not necessary.
I'm too old now.

562
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:15,469
Besides, I'm fixed down there.

563
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:27,084
Hello, my name is Fu Cheng Wen.

564
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:28,845
Gao Hwei Lan.

565
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,953
Can we go now?

566
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:39,222
- What time are you getting back?
- Before midnight.

567
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,531
You're a doctor?

568
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:53,035
I've got a wart on my left calf.
It's driving me nuts.

569
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,735
Can you tell me if it's cancer?

570
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,665
Fung Ling restaurant.

571
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,270
My last wife made me take lessons.

572
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,533
The whole year, she would scream:

573
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:28,177
"Alan! More hip action!"

574
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,869
Shake your ass more!

575
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,646
Now when we see each other...

576
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,548
...we don't speak. We just dance.

577
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:39,746
It's better than marriage.

578
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,926
Fung Ling restaurant.

579
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:50,460
Huge she-crab. So much egg.

580
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:19,322
I think I'm too old to have a child.

581
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,033
What makes you say that?

582
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,703
If these are my dating options...

583
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:31,304
...I am definitely too old.

584
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:35,036
Ma, I gotta get up early tomorrow.

585
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,313
There's not much left on this tape.

586
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,149
Why are you in street clothes?

587
00:48:41,352 --> 00:48:44,480
So I don't have to change
in the morning.

588
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:47,249
I can't believe you came
from my womb.

589
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,119
Is that the good guy?

590
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,760
No. He's marrying her for money.

591
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,629
Is that the good guy?

592
00:48:58,836 --> 00:48:59,962
No.

593
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,335
That's his brother.

594
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,633
Then who's that guy?

595
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,244
He's the most evil of them all.

596
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:12,045
He wants to ruin her family
to avenge a grudge.

597
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,208
Who's the loser
they're beating up?

598
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,977
That's the good guy.

599
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,582
I have found her a husband.

600
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:24,221
She will marry Cho. To the right.

601
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,992
I don't think Ma likes him.

602
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,566
What's not to like? Back left.

603
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,004
He's kind of intense.

604
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,536
Who cares?

605
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:39,272
He's a good man
who will take care of your mother...

606
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:43,345
...and give both her
and that child a decent name.

607
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,709
Where can you find
a man like that?

608
00:49:45,917 --> 00:49:50,877
You will help her see this.

609
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,683
I don't think she sees anything
she doesn't want to.

610
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:58,754
She shouldn't be alone.

611
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,965
Don't listen to him.

612
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:08,070
Another misunderstanding.
Now they'll never get together.

613
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:10,240
He shouldn't have slept
with another woman.

614
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,432
He didn't really. He was drunk.

615
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,407
That's a pathetic excuse.
She should go it alone without him.

616
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:17,080
She'd be lonely.

617
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:20,881
Are you lonely?

618
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:23,576
No, I have you.

619
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:25,278
Why?

620
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,451
It's too late for me.

621
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:35,430
- What about a father for your child?
- I raised you single-handedly.

622
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:36,827
You turned out all right.

623
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:40,198
I just think you should give
that Cho a chance.

624
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:43,534
Then you wouldn't be alone...

625
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,975
...and it would make
Grandpa happy.

626
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,384
Enough soap opera for today.

627
00:51:03,995 --> 00:51:08,159
I'm going to be a terrible mother.

628
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:13,794
What?

629
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,370
I don't even like babies.

630
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,608
Stephen's always bringing his kid
to the shop.

631
00:51:21,813 --> 00:51:26,113
All that drooling. Gross.

632
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:29,477
You were different.

633
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,519
You sprung from the womb
already grown-up.

634
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,819
And I had your father
during your early years.

635
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:43,864
He was really patient.

636
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,532
You have me.

637
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,036
I can hear your stomach.

638
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,478
What's it say?

639
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,716
"Blub."

640
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,017
"Blub."

641
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,478
It's not very articulate.

642
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,250
Oh, but yours is?

643
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,885
Mine sings arias...

644
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,723
...spouts poetry, proofs.

645
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:25,135
My mom used to do that.

646
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:27,777
Put me right to sleep.

647
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,070
Really?

648
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:35,879
I bet she has some great tips
on how to deal with you.

649
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:39,086
We should....

650
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,485
We should get together
and compare notes.

651
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,551
Thank God that'll never happen.

652
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,329
So...

653
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,741
...is this all we are?

654
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,536
I'm just starting to feel
like we're having an illicit affair.

655
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:08,015
We never do anything.
We never see anyone.

656
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,883
I love holing up with you, but....

657
00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:25,492
Sorry.

658
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,900
I'd like to see your place.

659
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,677
I have a pregnant mother at home.

660
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:38,847
I'd like to meet her.

661
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,882
She's not ready.

662
00:53:41,085 --> 00:53:44,111
It's been weeks.
Just tell her I'm a friend...

663
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,347
...a nice Chinese girl.

664
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:49,891
- You're not just a nice Chinese girl.
- I'll fake it.

665
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:51,823
You don't know my mom.

666
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,656
Exactly.

667
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,082
Fish is good, Auntie.

668
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,187
What do you do?

669
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,018
Vivian's a dancer.

670
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:23,787
A go-go dancer?

671
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:32,963
I dance with
the New York City Ballet.

672
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,637
Oh, ballet.

673
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,673
But now I'm...

674
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:44,107
...taking a break to dance modern.

675
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:46,741
Modern?

676
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,522
Less classical, more expressive.

677
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,987
She's very, very good.

678
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,455
Not ballet.

679
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,499
So is the baby good?

680
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:13,905
She works too hard.

681
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:17,911
I hardly get to see her.

682
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,246
Me neither.

683
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:38,428
So do you have a boyfriend?

684
00:55:43,838 --> 00:55:44,805
No.

685
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:48,630
Pretty girl like you must have
lots of boys ask you out.

686
00:55:52,713 --> 00:55:55,204
Wil's black neighbor is single...

687
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,475
...always around.

688
00:55:57,685 --> 00:55:59,778
You interested?

689
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:01,582
No.

690
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:04,991
- You don't like black people?
- Sure, I like--

691
00:56:05,192 --> 00:56:07,592
- She doesn't like black people.
- Yes, she does.

692
00:56:07,795 --> 00:56:10,662
- Then why won't she date them?
- Let's just eat.

693
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:28,205
Ma?

694
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:31,340
You're waiting for me now?

695
00:56:31,552 --> 00:56:34,282
I just want to make sure
my baby gets home safe.

696
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:38,015
Well, what if I have other plans?

697
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:43,993
Hey, Little Yu.
Isn't my daughter beautiful?

698
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:45,797
She is indeed.

699
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:47,796
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

700
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:49,094
Train's here.

701
00:56:49,904 --> 00:56:53,499
Thank your father.
I'll be calling him tonight.

702
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:57,303
Little Yu's got a solid job
and good benefits.

703
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:04,374
I'm getting a bridal contact high.

704
00:57:04,585 --> 00:57:07,884
I feel virginal, fertile.

705
00:57:09,957 --> 00:57:11,788
Where are my bridesmaids?

706
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:17,496
Seriously, Wil, why don't
you just tell her?

707
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:22,835
- She knows.
- She does?

708
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:25,835
She dropped by my apartment
a couple years ago unannounced.

709
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,667
She caught you.

710
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:30,276
So, what'd she say?

711
00:57:30,478 --> 00:57:31,968
Nothing.

712
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:34,942
She dropped some dumplings
on the table and left.

713
00:57:35,149 --> 00:57:37,208
We haven't talked about it since.

714
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:38,942
She kept setting you up
with guys?

715
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,549
That's when it started.

716
00:57:54,802 --> 00:57:58,067
- Great crab, isn't it?
- Smells delicious.

717
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:00,536
There's an old tradition
in Shanghai.

718
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:04,199
They pick their son-in-law based on
his skill at extracting his crab meat.

719
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:08,512
What am I saying?

720
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:11,947
You can't have crab
because of the--

721
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:20,522
Your child would be my child.

722
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:25,662
I would make sure you have anything
you want for the rest of your life.

723
00:58:25,866 --> 00:58:28,630
I just want you to be happy.

724
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:37,376
There are many women
who would be happy with you.

725
00:58:38,045 --> 00:58:40,513
Wouldn't you rather
have someone younger?

726
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:45,675
Younger people. Today they love you.
Tomorrow, who knows?

727
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:51,082
It's better to stick with someone
who can really understand you.

728
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:53,083
Besides...

729
00:58:54,462 --> 00:58:56,589
...I've liked you for over 15 years.

730
00:59:08,242 --> 00:59:09,766
I had a lovely time.

731
00:59:11,078 --> 00:59:13,774
You look lovely in this light.

732
00:59:18,385 --> 00:59:21,047
- Hey, Mrs. P.
- Hi!

733
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:24,049
Pardon me. I was just leaving.

734
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:30,324
He's a lumpy-looking guy.

735
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,690
Yeah.

736
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,858
Are you guys gonna kiss?

737
01:00:01,629 --> 01:00:03,062
No. What?

738
01:00:03,264 --> 01:00:06,199
Are you going to French kiss
when you go to Paris?

739
01:00:08,969 --> 01:00:10,402
Go play on the jungle gym.

740
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:20,202
I got the gig
at the Paris Opera Ballet.

741
01:00:26,654 --> 01:00:28,645
Four-year contract.

742
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:35,418
That's great.

743
01:00:35,996 --> 01:00:38,396
Wow, what an incredible opportunity.

744
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:41,792
I'm proud of you.

745
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:45,262
When are you leaving?

746
01:00:51,212 --> 01:00:52,770
I don't know.

747
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:58,074
Deadline to accept is next week.

748
01:01:02,556 --> 01:01:05,457
Well, congratulations.

749
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:42,395
Wonder how the gang is doing
over at the salon.

750
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:45,031
Then why don't you go in?

751
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:56,536
Mrs. Wong's really upset because
Raymond's dating a white girl.

752
01:01:57,678 --> 01:02:00,875
And Mrs. Chen,
she's been really bitter...

753
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:04,107
...because her husband lost
a pile of money on the stock market.

754
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:09,620
Carrying one child and sending
the other out to do her dirty work.

755
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:12,314
She never could
take care of herself.

756
01:02:14,328 --> 01:02:18,321
Who could the father be?

757
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:24,270
Do you think the father...

758
01:02:24,972 --> 01:02:27,031
...is someone in our circle?

759
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:31,507
No way. Fred is too respectful.

760
01:02:31,712 --> 01:02:34,545
Len is too scared.

761
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:37,239
Too lazy.

762
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:42,650
Too busy losing money.

763
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:44,687
Thank God.

764
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:48,089
Good to know we're safe.

765
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:52,129
Hello, Wilhelmina.
How is that mother of yours?

766
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:56,998
Didn't you see her the other day
at her mahjong party?

767
01:02:57,204 --> 01:03:00,640
Oh, no. I was busy.
I wasn't able to make it.

768
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:04,743
Me too.
Everyone's so busy these days.

769
01:03:04,945 --> 01:03:07,209
I heard no one went.

770
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:15,846
Ma?

771
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:21,221
Nothing.

772
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:29,759
Ma?

773
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,767
What?

774
01:03:34,008 --> 01:03:35,999
Do you like Cho?

775
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:39,902
He's a nice man.

776
01:03:40,714 --> 01:03:44,775
But do you like him?

777
01:03:48,322 --> 01:03:50,756
I just told you. I like him fine.

778
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:58,357
Do you think Ma should marry Cho?

779
01:03:59,867 --> 01:04:01,698
Does she love him?

780
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:06,598
I don't think so.

781
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:35,163
Deadline for Paris is Friday.

782
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,499
You must be excited.

783
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:45,506
Well, it's Paris.

784
01:04:45,712 --> 01:04:49,978
It's professional validation.

785
01:04:50,784 --> 01:04:52,115
But...

786
01:04:53,687 --> 01:04:56,247
...I have new things here...

787
01:04:57,224 --> 01:04:58,885
...new work.

788
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:02,618
I-- I just....

789
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:08,328
I don't know if it'll pan out.

790
01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:14,974
It's a pretty big thing to pass up.

791
01:05:17,978 --> 01:05:19,377
Yeah.

792
01:05:44,004 --> 01:05:46,234
Mr. Cho took you to the hospital?

793
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,307
He's a good man.

794
01:05:50,544 --> 01:05:53,945
Don't worry, Professor Gao.
Your wife's okay.

795
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:57,379
Your grandmother's lungs aren't
as strong as we'd like to see them...

796
01:05:57,584 --> 01:05:59,916
...but I believe
she'll pull through fine.

797
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,816
I'd like to keep her in here
for another few days.

798
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:07,187
Vivian, what are you doing here?

799
01:06:07,394 --> 01:06:09,828
I couldn't sleep...

800
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,227
...so I thought
I'd get some coffee with you.

801
01:06:17,971 --> 01:06:19,529
My daughter.

802
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:21,538
Wil.

803
01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:23,675
Vivian.

804
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:31,818
Why don't we get breakfast.

805
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:36,149
After I finish up here, we can
talk about your training in Paris.

806
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:40,624
Wil, can I grab you for a second?

807
01:06:49,736 --> 01:06:53,001
So you're the reason
she's dragging her heels on Paris.

808
01:07:04,985 --> 01:07:06,816
She was 6...

809
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:09,648
...the first time I saw her dance.

810
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:12,882
She blew away all the other girls.

811
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,827
I haven't missed
a single performance since.

812
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,661
Do you love her?

813
01:07:31,011 --> 01:07:33,912
If she doesn't take this job in Paris...

814
01:07:34,114 --> 01:07:36,776
...she may never
realize her greatness.

815
01:07:44,191 --> 01:07:45,954
I understand.

816
01:07:52,532 --> 01:07:54,727
What were you all so worried about?

817
01:07:54,935 --> 01:07:56,800
Haven't I been healthy all these years?

818
01:07:57,037 --> 01:07:59,562
This is nothing compared to war.

819
01:07:59,806 --> 01:08:01,273
Don't excite yourself.

820
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:03,066
That's right, Mrs. Gao.
Just relax.

821
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:07,212
You relax. Preferably elsewhere.
I want to speak to my granddaughter.

822
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:10,038
I'll be back later.

823
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,445
Me too.

824
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,988
Thank God they're gone.

825
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:21,393
Like I'm so bored I have to listen
to his asinine pandering!

826
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,124
How's your mother?

827
01:08:24,564 --> 01:08:25,792
She's doing well.

828
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:27,499
You're talking to me.

829
01:08:29,236 --> 01:08:32,763
She's totally depressed
and humiliated.

830
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:38,002
Don't tell her about this.

831
01:08:39,046 --> 01:08:40,741
How can I not?

832
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:42,773
She has enough on her mind.

833
01:08:43,016 --> 01:08:45,348
Your grandfather forbids her
to come anyway.

834
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:48,283
It'll just make her feel bad.

835
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:50,178
I'll be out soon.

836
01:08:50,424 --> 01:08:53,188
Promise you won't tell her
until I'm back home.

837
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:54,821
Grandma....

838
01:08:55,162 --> 01:08:56,493
Promise me.

839
01:09:03,403 --> 01:09:05,132
You're just in time.

840
01:09:05,405 --> 01:09:08,340
She's watching his plane
take off for the States.

841
01:09:22,856 --> 01:09:25,586
Vivian's been leaving messages
out the ying-yang.

842
01:09:25,792 --> 01:09:27,692
Hey. It's me.

843
01:09:28,528 --> 01:09:31,520
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

844
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:36,664
So are you still coming around
the theater tonight?

845
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:38,531
Yeah. Just let me know.

846
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:40,866
Okay. Bye.

847
01:09:49,049 --> 01:09:51,483
Hey. I'm going into rehearsal
in a few minutes...

848
01:09:51,685 --> 01:09:54,552
...so my cell's gonna be off
until after the show.

849
01:09:54,755 --> 01:09:57,883
But am I gonna see you after work?

850
01:09:59,025 --> 01:10:01,050
I'll just talk to you later.

851
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:06,463
And, folks, it will help
if you putt to a smaller object....

852
01:10:24,851 --> 01:10:30,050
Your hot dog got cold
so I fed it to the birds.

853
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:32,856
Careful.

854
01:10:33,059 --> 01:10:35,527
We don't wanna train them
to eat flesh.

855
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:48,337
So how's your grandma?

856
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:52,234
Okay.

857
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,314
Where have you been
the last couple days?

858
01:10:58,318 --> 01:11:00,718
It's been crazy.

859
01:11:10,197 --> 01:11:11,824
Vivian...

860
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,061
...there's a lot going on right now.

861
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,933
I'm sorry if l....

862
01:11:22,509 --> 01:11:25,273
If this hurts.

863
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:32,683
At least it's not a flesh wound.

864
01:12:10,724 --> 01:12:11,986
Ma?

865
01:12:12,192 --> 01:12:15,127
Stupid girl,
he's so obviously right for you.

866
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:18,592
Ma.

867
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:20,862
We need to talk.

868
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:23,326
There's not much left on this tape.

869
01:12:25,272 --> 01:12:27,206
I don't think this can wait.

870
01:12:41,755 --> 01:12:43,245
Ma.

871
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:51,488
I love you.

872
01:12:52,299 --> 01:12:54,767
And I'm gay.

873
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:04,005
How can you say
those two things at once?

874
01:13:06,246 --> 01:13:08,544
How can you tell me you love me...

875
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:10,773
...then throw that in my face?

876
01:13:13,486 --> 01:13:15,181
I am not a bad mother.

877
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:17,446
My daughter is not gay.

878
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:28,594
Then maybe I shouldn't be
your daughter.

879
01:15:39,599 --> 01:15:41,658
I can't believe she's gonna do it.

880
01:15:45,705 --> 01:15:47,468
Crazy.

881
01:15:47,774 --> 01:15:48,968
Who are you, a bridesmaid?

882
01:15:51,077 --> 01:15:53,307
I'm not invited.

883
01:15:55,081 --> 01:15:57,208
Ma's not speaking to me anyway.

884
01:15:59,352 --> 01:16:01,115
So...

885
01:16:02,255 --> 01:16:05,452
...you're really not gonna see
Vivian off to the airport?

886
01:16:06,993 --> 01:16:10,326
- We broke up.
- So?

887
01:16:12,565 --> 01:16:14,533
We broke up.

888
01:16:27,213 --> 01:16:28,771
Hey.

889
01:16:29,816 --> 01:16:31,807
My dad said this is for the bride.

890
01:16:34,921 --> 01:16:36,388
Jesus.

891
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:46,663
Damn it!

892
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:20,866
"Hwei Lan...

893
01:17:21,868 --> 01:17:23,995
...you keep refusing to see me.

894
01:17:24,237 --> 01:17:27,001
By the time you read this...

895
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:32,372
...you may already be Cho's bride.

896
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,676
You've said this is the way
fate would have it...

897
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:45,017
...but if it is your fate
to do your father's bidding...

898
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:50,093
...then it is my fate to try...

899
01:17:50,296 --> 01:17:52,787
...and undo yours.

900
01:17:52,999 --> 01:17:57,959
Yes, people would talk
about the age difference...."

901
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,967
Oh, my God.

902
01:18:03,643 --> 01:18:05,372
It's Old Yu!

903
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:09,077
I may not be what you pictured
as your future.

904
01:18:09,582 --> 01:18:12,983
But I know now that I am the one
destined for you.

905
01:18:13,386 --> 01:18:14,648
I love you.

906
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:16,253
I know you love me.

907
01:18:16,456 --> 01:18:18,754
Shouldn't this be simple?

908
01:18:20,593 --> 01:18:21,651
Twenty-nine years ago...

909
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:26,529
...you married a man you didn't love
to be the perfect daughter...

910
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:30,098
...and now you're doing it again,
all for your father's honor.

911
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:40,507
Dad.

912
01:19:12,578 --> 01:19:14,045
Ma!

913
01:19:15,848 --> 01:19:16,815
Wait!

914
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:18,943
Wait a moment!

915
01:19:19,485 --> 01:19:20,611
What's going on?

916
01:19:21,688 --> 01:19:24,418
I read the letter. I know.

917
01:19:24,657 --> 01:19:26,887
Wil, quiet! You're causing a scene!

918
01:19:28,728 --> 01:19:31,424
You know what? What letter?

919
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:32,892
Don't marry him!

920
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:35,564
Marry the one you love.

921
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:37,633
Wait a minute.

922
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:39,833
You don't love me?

923
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:41,301
Of course she loves you!

924
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:43,304
Say it! You love him!

925
01:19:43,743 --> 01:19:44,801
No!

926
01:19:45,845 --> 01:19:47,142
No, she doesn't.

927
01:19:47,714 --> 01:19:49,011
She loves him!

928
01:19:50,183 --> 01:19:52,344
This is a mistake!
It's not me! It's not me!

929
01:19:53,152 --> 01:19:54,744
- Yes, it is!
- No, it's not!

930
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:55,749
Wilhelmina!

931
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:57,115
It's me.

932
01:20:02,095 --> 01:20:03,187
Are you insane?

933
01:20:04,364 --> 01:20:07,094
- That woman's karma kills husbands!
- Pa, I love her!

934
01:20:08,868 --> 01:20:11,666
I told you to marry
the Hong Kong movie star!

935
01:20:12,572 --> 01:20:13,539
At least she doesn't have kids!

936
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,937
- lf you want a divorce, just say so!
- You want it!

937
01:20:17,176 --> 01:20:20,373
- ldiot, I love you!
- Dog fart! I love you!

938
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:36,386
I am indebted to you...

939
01:20:37,563 --> 01:20:39,394
...but I don't love you.

940
01:20:44,003 --> 01:20:45,095
Dad.

941
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,369
I am so sorry.

942
01:20:53,713 --> 01:20:55,180
I can't.

943
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:03,411
You have thrown away
a lifetime of my reputation!

944
01:21:04,657 --> 01:21:06,522
Father, please.

945
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:48,458
Fantastic! I'll move back in with you.

946
01:21:49,035 --> 01:21:53,131
We'll need a bigger bed,
so the baby can sleep with me.

947
01:21:53,372 --> 01:21:56,671
Later, we'll block off the living room
for her crib and--

948
01:21:56,943 --> 01:21:58,137
No, Ma. Wait.

949
01:21:58,611 --> 01:22:01,774
We really should repaint.
Rose beige would be nice.

950
01:22:02,215 --> 01:22:04,149
It would warm the place up nicely!

951
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,410
No.

952
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:28,265
You know what I don't understand?

953
01:22:29,842 --> 01:22:31,776
Why did you make us
go through this?

954
01:22:31,978 --> 01:22:35,744
Why didn't you just say it was
Little Yu and be together?

955
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:38,948
He's young.

956
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:41,613
Handsome.

957
01:22:42,855 --> 01:22:44,413
He could have anyone.

958
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:48,691
He's obviously in love with you.

959
01:22:50,363 --> 01:22:51,762
Today he loves me.

960
01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:54,198
Tomorrow, who knows?

961
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:03,706
I guess I needed him to declare it.
Not just to me, but to everyone.

962
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,579
Besides, I'd never dated before.

963
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:13,714
I may as well see what's out there.

964
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:27,359
You know...

965
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,897
...that Vivian...

966
01:23:29,735 --> 01:23:30,997
...she seems nice.

967
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:38,369
She's leaving for Paris tonight.

968
01:23:41,948 --> 01:23:43,415
You like her, don't you?

969
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,687
Stop the bus!

970
01:23:57,830 --> 01:24:02,563
- You stay-- Get--
- Wait! Wait!

971
01:24:08,341 --> 01:24:09,865
Vivian!

972
01:24:11,577 --> 01:24:14,705
- I gotta catch my flight.
- Don't go. Wait.

973
01:24:14,914 --> 01:24:16,404
That's what I do. I wait.

974
01:24:16,616 --> 01:24:19,915
I hang around, waiting to catch
a precious moment with you...

975
01:24:20,119 --> 01:24:22,383
...between your mom and your beeper.
I'm sick of it.

976
01:24:22,588 --> 01:24:24,647
We'll have more time
after my residency.

977
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:27,348
It's not the time, Wil.
It's how you feel.

978
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,028
You're too scared to look
the world in the eye...

979
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:33,790
...and let it watch you fall in love.
You're off and running without a fight.

980
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,797
I'm not the one running off to Paris.

981
01:24:36,002 --> 01:24:38,562
Don't flatter yourself.
It's for the ballet.

982
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:40,762
I thought you wanted to do modern.

983
01:24:40,973 --> 01:24:43,407
What do you fucking care
what kind of dancing I do?

984
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:45,770
Punish me by leaving. Fine.

985
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:49,414
Don't punish yourself by treating
your dreams like they're for shit.

986
01:24:57,857 --> 01:24:59,415
Kiss me.

987
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,693
Right here, in front of all these people.

988
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:16,368
Vivian.

989
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:20,336
Vivian, I love you.

990
01:26:44,096 --> 01:26:45,586
- Working late again?
- Not tonight.

991
01:26:45,798 --> 01:26:48,460
- Off to Planet China.
- Thought you didn't have to do that.

992
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,261
Ma insisted. I have to be
there tonight for some reason.

993
01:26:51,470 --> 01:26:54,871
- She still goes to those things?
- All the ladies bug her for advice now.

994
01:26:59,812 --> 01:27:01,109
You're late as usual.

995
01:27:01,313 --> 01:27:02,302
Hi, Ma.

996
01:27:18,964 --> 01:27:20,022
Wil, it's been so long.

997
01:27:20,299 --> 01:27:23,632
Busy lately? Try some of this jerky.

998
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:26,463
Yeah, it's been a busy spring.

999
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:29,731
Well, a full belly conquers all.

1000
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:51,391
It is 4 a.m. in Paris.
Can we please go home now?

1001
01:27:52,131 --> 01:27:56,033
I'm not spending my entire break
in Planet China.

1002
01:28:02,174 --> 01:28:03,937
You promised she wouldn't be here.

1003
01:28:04,143 --> 01:28:05,770
She hasn't been coming for a while.

1004
01:28:49,188 --> 01:28:50,746
Dance with me?

1005
01:28:52,858 --> 01:28:54,450
Wil....

1006
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:57,557
Vivian Shing.

1007
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:01,262
I am asking you to dance with me.

1008
01:29:06,272 --> 01:29:07,569
I can't.

1009
01:29:15,714 --> 01:29:17,113
There's no music.

1010
01:29:55,321 --> 01:29:57,414
So now will you let me move in?

1011
01:29:57,623 --> 01:29:58,612
No way!

1012
01:29:58,824 --> 01:30:00,951
This is the first time
I've ever had my own place.

1013
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:03,286
You're gonna cramp my style.

1014
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:07,127
The world is getting too hard
to predict.

1015
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:08,890
It just keeps getting worse.

1016
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:22,906
Revolting!

1017
01:30:24,617 --> 01:30:25,811
Let's go.

1018
01:30:26,051 --> 01:30:27,313
One more bite.

1019
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:31,085
Folks are leaving.

1020
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:40,592
- Fuck them.
- Fuck them.

1021
01:31:28,847 --> 01:31:32,840
Fifteen years is too damn long to wait.
If you like her, go for it.

1022
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:34,519
How's your squab?

1023
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:36,711
Oh, it's good.

1024
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:42,224
You finally saw Vivian's new show.
What do you think?

1025
01:31:43,796 --> 01:31:47,061
- I didn't get it.
- Me neither.

1026
01:31:47,266 --> 01:31:49,291
Well, at least she's marrying a doctor.

1027
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:56,869
Stop patting that side.
The baby will turn out lopsided.

1028
01:31:57,076 --> 01:31:58,202
Don't be silly.

1029
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,378
Patting isn't bad for the kid,
right, Wil?

1030
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:02,706
Yeah. But disagreeing
with her mother is.

1031
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:03,882
Well said!

1032
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:11,986
The moment that girl is born,
I'm coming over every day.

1033
01:32:12,658 --> 01:32:17,391
God knows how she'll turn out
if she's brought up by you two.

1034
01:32:20,299 --> 01:32:23,063
Nice shirt, Vivian.

1035
01:32:23,902 --> 01:32:26,803
Now why can't you wear
something pleasant like that?

1036
01:32:27,005 --> 01:32:30,736
- Because I like to be nagged.
- I'll work on her.

1037
01:32:32,811 --> 01:32:35,371
So there's only one thing left.

1038
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:38,449
When are you going to have a baby?
