5
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:21,083
WOMAN: I want something that says,
"I'm sorry he's dead...

6
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:23,087
"but not that sorry.

7
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,219
"He was just a dog and you shouldn't
have loved him more than me."

8
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:30,094
Can you do me a bunch that says that?

9
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:35,907
Rachel, darling,
tell your father he can't wear that suit.

10
00:01:36,014 --> 00:01:37,449
RACHEL: He looks nice.

11
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:40,846
- You look nice.
- Thank you, poppet.

12

13

TESSA: Oh, God, will somebody please put
a gag on my daughter?

15
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:47,730
Why is the alphabet in that order?

16
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:52,141
Nobody knows, nobody cares. So, for once
in your little life, would you just...

17
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:55,848
What do you think?

18
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:59,782
- Holy wow.
- Oh, darling.

19
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:01,453
You look like a meringue.

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,159
Good.

21
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,673
- You're late.
- Balls.

22
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,142
- What's the job?
- Wedding.

23
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:11,147
- You always pull.
- One of us has to.

24
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,843
- Nice couple?
- Haven't met them.

25
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,646
- All about the mother.
- Isn't it always?

26
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:17,753
- Come out with me afterwards.
- Sure.

27
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:19,627
- You will?
- Absolutely.

28
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:23,296
- Oh, cool. Well, we'll go together.
- I'll meet you there.

29
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,510
- You're not coming.
- My favorite advert's on TV.

30
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,847
- You need a love life.
- I have a "like" life. It suits me fine.

31
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,953
No, I feel good, actually, bizarrely good.

32
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:35,858
Yeah, yeah, no nerves at all.
None whatsoever. Thanks.

33
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,722
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Hi.

34
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,763
- Hi.
- You're Hector, right, the groom?

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah, yeah, I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call me Heck.

36
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:44,412
- Well, I did your flowers.
- Oh, did you?

37
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:46,982
Oh, well, they're fabulous.
Aren't they, Coop?

38
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:51,116
Fabulous, yeah. Although, I wouldn't know
a nice flower from a poke in the eye.

39
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,354
But they're fabulous, aren't they, Coop?

40
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:53,430
(Luce chuckles)

41
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,432
So, Ned, how long
have you guys been married, then?

42
00:02:58,641 --> 00:02:59,631
Thirty years.

43
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,082
If I'd killed her when I first thought
about it, I'd be out by now.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,213
A free man.

45
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:11,763
I remember all the way to the church
I just wanted to shout...

46
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:15,772
"Stop the car! This is a horrible mistake."

47
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,971
But you can't, can you?

48
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:23,954
So, you just sit there, say nothing...

49
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:28,895
as the wheels keep turning,
leading you on to the longest sentence...

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,665
Stop the car! I forgot to pee.

51
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:43,289
All right, panic over.

52
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:44,453
They're here now.

53
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:47,329
- Good luck, chum.
- All right, Tessa? You all right?

54
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,130
- Hi, Heck.
- Hi, babe.

55
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:50,400
LUCE: You want some help with this thing?

56
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,037
Yes.

57
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:54,139
I do work out, yes.

58
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:56,478
- Don't have a six-pack.
- No?

59
00:03:56,585 --> 00:04:00,923
- No, 12-pack on this puppy.
- I don't really like men with muscles.

60
00:04:01,028 --> 00:04:04,523
The bonus is, though, I'm very...
I'm very sensitive, too.

61
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:06,065
Heck, I've got a question.

62
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:07,161
TESSA: Not now.

63
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,241
What's the question, H?

64
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:11,746
What happens when an unstoppable force
meets a immovable object?

65
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,055
I haven't got a bastard clue, I'm afraid.

66
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:18,925
There you are, you see.
Now we can let him get married in peace.

67
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,762
It never happens.
If there's a thing that can't be stopped...

68
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:26,434
it's not possible for there to be something
else which can't be moved, and vice versa.

69
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:30,013
They can't both exist.
You see, it's a trick question...

70
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,476
is the answer.

71
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,554
Can she sit with me?

72
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,862
- So what am I doing here?
- When do fish sleep?

73
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:40,329
(Organ playing)

74
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:45,512
- She's coming round, is she?
- She is coming.

75
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,779
Of course she is.

76
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:48,886
Yep.

77
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,723
When? When's she coming?

78
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,422
- What's your name, anyway?
- Everyone calls me "H."

79
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:57,032
They tell me it's short for Henrietta,
but it's not.

80
00:04:57,137 --> 00:04:59,334
It's short for Jesus "H" Christ.

81
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,778
That's what my mummy said when she
found out she was pregnant with me.

82
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:04,875
Isn't Heck handsome?

83
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:08,523
- I fancy that flower girl.
- Yeah, yeah, I know you do.

84
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:12,727
She likes me, right?
I got a vibe that she likes me.

85
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,301
Coop, it's my wedding day.
Can we talk about me?

86
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,634
Sure, yes.

87
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:22,815
(Whispering) Did you get the vibe
that she likes me?

88
00:05:30,702 --> 00:05:33,469
Right, last one to the altar's a sissy.

89
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:41,750
- Well, this is it.
- Wish me luck.

90
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,719
Wish you luck?

91
00:05:43,827 --> 00:05:46,662
It's a wedding.
Bridesmaids always blow weddings.

92
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,631
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

93

(Organ playing)

94
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:55,203
She's here.

95
00:05:55,683 --> 00:05:58,279
Okay, you're sorted.
I'm gonna set up the reception.

96
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:00,123
Excuse me.

98
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,567
- All good?
- Always.

99
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:47,446
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

100
00:06:47,884 --> 00:06:50,548
and in the face of this congregation...

101
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,889
- You look beautiful.
...to join together this man...

102
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,333
and this woman in holy matrimony.

103
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:01,237
WOMAN: Congratulations!

104
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:03,011

Please keep your arms by your side.
It's like dancing with a gibbon.

107
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:29,690
Nothing.

108
00:07:32,403 --> 00:07:33,667
Nothing.

110
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,257
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:52,374
- We haven't met. I'm Luce.
- Rachel.

112
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,173
- I did your flowers.
- You did? My flowers are nice.

113
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:58,776
Anyway, I was just gonna get...

114
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:02,154
a drink.

115
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,431
I wouldn't.

116
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:08,701
What, is there something wrong?
I'm here to help.

117
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:13,440
My ring. I was getting some
of this punch crap and...

118
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,053
- Your wedding ring?
- It fell off.

119
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,689
Off and in there.
My wedding ring is in there.

120
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:22,429
- And you tried the ladle?
- Nothing.

121
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,025
- And you can't empty...
- No.

122
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,765
No, it's too big.

123
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:29,813
- Right. Only one thing to do. Cover me.
- What?

124
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:32,143
Use the dress. I'm going in.

125
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,951
You can't just... Oh, yes, really, you can.

126

(Clearing throat) Hi.

127
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,198
They say white's the color of virgins.

128
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:43,796
If I know Hector, the only thing virgin
round here is the olive oil.

aren't they?

but not in the biblical sense.

You're just like he described.

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,364
ROB: Now, I need booze.
I've just met a cracking filly...

00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,539
- This is Luce. She's a florist.
- Name's Rob.

and I think that that's boring.

161

They've been in love for years, years!

of drugs consumed...

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,939
Rachel and Hector.

172
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,247
ALL: Rachel and Hector.

173
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,320
Oh, and, now, this is a very big deal.

174
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,762
Some say the reason it's taken him
this long to get married is his fear...

175
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,637
of making just this speech,
but he's making it now!

176
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:39,373
He's not sure he can do it,
I know he can do it.

177
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:43,478
Please put it together repeatedly,
here's Hecky!

178
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,991
(All cheering)

179
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,514
(Clearing throat)

180
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,502
I know something that helps, Hector.
Imagine everybody naked.

181
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:19,125
Hi, everyone. I'm Heck...

182
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:22,197
and welcome to my wedding.

183
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,662
(All laughing)

184
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,972
So, I'm glad you're all here
looking at me because...

185
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:31,336
'cause I want to tell you
how much I love Rachel.

186
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:36,782
What an amazing, wonderful,
uniquely fantastic person she is.

187
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:41,932
- Do you want to keep going?
- No, no, I think you're doing great.

188
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,236
Okay, so this is me now.

189
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,277
I've been looking forward
to this day all my life.

190
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:55,561
And I'm glad to share it
with so many people I love...

191
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:57,896
and a few people I've never met before.

192
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,229
(All laughing)

193
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:00,962
But I'm sure you're all great, too.

194
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,270
(Rachel chuckling)

195
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:09,654
I feel like I've known Heck all my life.
And I know I'll know him for the rest of it.

196
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:12,856
He's my best friend.

197
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:19,507
They say fairytales have happy endings,
even though the passage can be rough.

198
00:13:20,477 --> 00:13:23,745
But Heck and I were mates
and then lovers.

199
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,411
And it's been smooth all the way.

200
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,664
Maybe that's a better kind of fairytale.

201
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,434
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear!

202
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,506
Sort of, toast-schmoast won't do all that.

203
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,376
But if you could all just wish us luck,
Heck and I would appreciate it very much.

204
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,779
All ready?

205
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,450
One, two, three.

206
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,853
ALL: Good luck!

207
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,941
- Hello.
- Hi.

208
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,984
You gotta help me. I need a flower.
Just one. A good one. The best.

209
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,284
- Okay.
- This is my last chance.

210
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,623
- My last-chance flower.
- Your last chance?

211
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,494
I really twatted up.

212
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:26,332
Only the right flower can save me.
What about a rose?

213
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:28,236
- A red rose, what would that say?
- Love.

214
00:14:28,342 --> 00:14:30,675
- Love's nice, that works.
- And fidelity.

215
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,942
- Not a red rose, then.
- No.

216
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,782
Not a rose at all. It's too obvious.

217
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:38,418
If this really is your last chance, we need
to find you something spectacular.

218
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,993
- Be right with you.
- That's fine.

219
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,232
- Hi.
- Hey.

220
00:14:46,644 --> 00:14:48,272
- How you doing?
- Good.

221
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:49,776
Great. I just...

222
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,318
MAN: See what's out here.

223
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:56,026
- Came by to say thanks.
- It was a total pleasure.

224
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,138
- Listen, sorry, I'm just dealing with...
- Oh, God, of course. Go right ahead.

225
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:02,434
MAN: What's your favorite flower?

226
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,172
I don't know. I think I like lilies.

227
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:08,212
They're wrong.

228
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:14,630
- How about this? Bird of paradise.
- Keep talking.

229
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:17,862
Real name's Strelitzia,
named after Charlotte of Strelitz.

230
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:21,809
She married King George III, had 15 kids.
They never spent more than an hour apart.

231
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:23,403
- Okay, stop talking.
- He actually...

232
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,352
- Do you want to come to dinner?
- Sorry?

233
00:15:26,788 --> 00:15:29,088
Dinner with us, Heck and me.

234
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:31,962
- I mean, you don't...
- I'd love to.

235
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,271
- Really? This Friday?
- Yeah, Friday. Why not?

236
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,442
Great, I'll just write down the...

237
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:41,038
MAN: Perfect.

238
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,655
This is the one. My last-chance flower.

239
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,888
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

240
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:55,206
AUCTIONEER: Next item, lot 48,
the 1930s American oak mantle clock.

241
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,011
Here at ?8. At ?8.

242
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:01,880
?0. Thank you. Lady bid ?0.
Lady bid ?0.

243
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:04,687
Okay, baby, now you got to glare,
give out the red eye.

244
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,492
I'd do it, it's just that you're
a lot more frightening.

245
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,658
No, I'm not.

246
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,637
- Who am I glaring at?
- Anyone who wants that sofa.

247
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:12,606
- They can't have it, it's mine.
- Ours.

248
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,510
- Ours?
- Lf it's under the limit, ?00.

249
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:19,688
- I don't see how we need a limit.
- I like limits, otherwise, you'll go mad.

250
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,758
Damn right I will. That thing is mine.

251
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:21,827
(Cash register ringing)

252
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:22,895
HECK: Ours.

253
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,528
(Whispering) Do you think
they'll have a limit?

254
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:28,404
?5. ?5...

255
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:31,776
I invited someone to dinner, Friday.
That florist, Luce.

256
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,849
- Lucy, whatever.
- Oh, great, I'll cook.

257
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:35,010
Please don't.

258
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,648
- Moving right along. Lot 49.
- Okay, baby, this is us.

259
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:40,423
The very attractive leather sofa, there.

260
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,665
Brown leather chesterfield,
brass stud decoration...

261
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,297
in slightly distressed condition at ?0.

262
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,401
I asked because... And this is my plan.

263
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,573
- Oh, no.
- I thought we'd get Coop along.

264
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:53,280
Great idea. Excellent. But what would be
better is if we didn't do that.

265
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,256
?0. Do I hear ?0?

266
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:58,023
Not from us. Come in late.
Psych them on the way out.

267
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:01,502
I think they'd be perfect for each other.
Don't you think they'd be perfect?

268
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,270
?00, ?00. ?10, thank you.

269
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:06,209
Red eye, baby. Still the red eye. Who?

270
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,250
Luce and Coop. I think they'd be perfect.

271
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,813
?20. ?30, thank you.

272
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:14,327
He did say that he was onto a
promise at the wedding before she bailed.

273
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,296
There you go. It's totally on.

274
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,597
- ?50 at the back.
- Okay.

275
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,098
It's funny.

276
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:23,972
I went round to say thank you
for what she did at our wedding.

277
00:17:24,082 --> 00:17:25,277
Not yet.

278
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,787
You know when you've just met someone
but straight away...

279
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:30,290
you feel as if they're going
to be your friend?

280
00:17:30,394 --> 00:17:32,830
- ?70, ?80.
- Nearly there.

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,302
Who knows why? Past life, physiognomy.

282
00:17:36,406 --> 00:17:37,634
?90.

283
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:40,338
But for some reason, you just kind of click.

284
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:41,436
Here we go.

285
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:43,916
?10? ?10.

286
00:17:44,655 --> 00:17:46,557
- ?10.
- Bollocks.

287
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,389
I don't know what I'm saying.
But do you know what I mean?

288
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,623
Are we there at ?10, all done at ?10?

289
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,667
Baby, we lost it. The sofa.

290
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,264
- What?
- Over our limit.

291
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,637
?00!

292
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,142
?00?

293
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:03,023
(Church bell chiming)

294
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:16,848
- What are you doing?
- I live here. What are you doing?

295
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:19,012
Came to tidy.

296
00:18:19,756 --> 00:18:21,315
You should be dressed, Mum.

297
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:24,591
Well, I was.
I'm just settling in for the evening.

298
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:28,001
It's 5:00.
You said you were going out later.

299
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,737
No, you said I was going out later.

300
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:35,744
- Have you finished work already?
- I'm busy tonight.

301
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:40,691
What, a date?
Does my daughter have a date?

302
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:44,063
No. But you could have.

303
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,338
(Groaning)

304
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:54,956
"Tea dances, reading groups,
bridge clubs."

305
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:59,127
Tragic attempts
by lonely old coffin dodgers...

306
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:02,432
to meet someone before they give up
and peg out.

307
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:04,666
Everybody looking for love.

308
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,680
Well, they won't find it,
and they certainly won't get sex.

309
00:19:07,782 --> 00:19:11,687
All those men are so old,
it'd be like playing snooker with a rope.

310
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:13,985
(Chuckling)

311
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:15,961
You know, those people are sad.

312
00:19:16,065 --> 00:19:17,694
- You're sad.
- No.

313
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,570
I'm depressed. There's a difference.

314
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,038
I wish you'd get a life.

315
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:26,707
I wish you would.

316
00:19:28,857 --> 00:19:30,052
Yes, I know you do.

317
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,532
Toby, I'm telling you, that's the number.
You've gotta believe me.

318
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:38,232
Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that.
We're friends. Aren't we friends?

319
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:42,509
Well, I like you. Look,
would you believe it if Heck told you?

320
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,019
You would? Thank you very much.

321
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:47,414
Hey, Toby.

322
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:51,225
Yeah, I know.
Weird, but believe him, okay?

323
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,636
Okay. Speak to you soon.

324
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,169
All good.

325
00:19:56,644 --> 00:20:01,210
- You see, the truth never fails.
- Yeah, except we were lying.

326
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:05,482
Hmm.

327
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,198
Sorry I'm late, beautiful person.

328
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:14,040
- You look spectacular.
- How was work?

329
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,645
Shite. Quitting.

330
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,343
You always say that.

331
00:20:18,453 --> 00:20:20,821
(Sighing) Just watch me. One day, I'll do it.

332
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:25,993
Tell them I don't like them or their cash.
Although I do like their cash.

333
00:20:26,334 --> 00:20:30,435
Whatever. I'll think of something
and then walk out.

334
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:31,567
(Toilet flushing)

335
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:33,271
I'll be waiting with champagne.

336
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:35,911
How much do I wish it was just us tonight.

337
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:38,080
He'll definitely be into her, right?

338
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,356
- Coop? He'll fancy Luce?
- She's got a pulse, hasn't she?

339
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:45,403
No, but, I mean... You do. You would?

340
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:49,536
Well, she's not really my bag of chips,
darling, but, yeah, I suppose.

341
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,519
- Oh, what do you think?
- Of her? I haven't really...

342
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,318
Oh, no, no. The shirt?

343
00:20:57,628 --> 00:20:58,596
Oh, uh...

344
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:02,161
- It's gorgeous. You're gorgeous.
- Yeah?

345
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:04,605
Want to fool around?

346
00:21:05,243 --> 00:21:06,404
(Doorbell ringing)

347
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:09,541
Saved by the bell.
But you're in a lot of trouble later.

348
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:13,852
HECK: Hey.
LUCE: Hey.

349
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,053
(Kissing)

350
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,725
- Come in. You look fab.
- Thank you.

351
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:21,238
- Guess what I brought?
- Oh, bless you. Rachel'll flip.

352
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,468
- Sweetheart.
- Here I am.

353
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,848
- Hey.
- Hi.

354
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,917
- So, come check out our new sofa.
- Our expensive new sofa.

355
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:34,466
- You can't put a price on comfort.
- You see, a woman after my own heart.

356
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:36,160
Listen, do you believe in reincarnation?

357
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,400
It's just that Rach thought
you guys had met before.

358
00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:43,278
- That's not quite what l...
- I'd have remembered, I think.

359
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:47,181
Well, let's hang these flowers
and get that jacket in some water.

360
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,553
- I'll do it.
- Ta.

361
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:51,892
- Thanks.
- Thank you, darling.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,835
HECK: Well, so, basically,
the book I've wanted to write is...

363
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,571
a guide to wherever is the coolest place
on the planet at the time.

364
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,808
If it's February, it's the Rio Carnival.

365
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:04,857
And if it's, I don't know, May,
it's bulls in Pamplona.

366
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:06,586
So, if you...

367
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:11,193
want a holiday /party, then,
you know, you open the book...

368
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:12,796
and there's me telling you where to go.

369
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,467
'Cause you've been there.

370
00:22:14,577 --> 00:22:17,606
Yeah, that was the plan, but, you know...

371
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:21,219
Rach, life, work.

372
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,753
- Rach.
- Some day.

373
00:22:24,162 --> 00:22:25,597
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

374
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,898
Anyway, how about you? Married?

375
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:32,140
Ever been married,
ever gonna be married?

376
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:35,274
No. No.
Maybe now the laws have changed.

377
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:36,644
- How do you mean?
- Well, I'm gay.

378
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,521
(Chuckling)

379
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,353
Mmm.

380
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:44,524
Lovely. Well done.

381
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:47,431
(Doorbell ringing)

382
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:53,609
- That'll be Cooper.
- Cooper's coming.

383
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:56,116
Yeah.

384
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,731
(Rachel clearing throat)

385
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,062
Mmm.

386
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:04,506
Heck?

387
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,936
- This is absolutely revolting.
- You think so?

388
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:10,382
It is, sweetheart. It's atrocious.

389
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:13,720
Anyway, more importantly, listen.
It's been three weeks now.

390
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:16,826
Let's have it.
How much better is sex after marriage?

391
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:18,696
- Please.
- Because, when I've had sex...

392
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:22,467
with people after they were married,
they have said that it's fantastic.

393
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,445
- Rach?
- Get wed and find out yourself.

394
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:26,879
Come on, Cooper couldn't make
that commitment.

395
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:28,681
We're talking about two or three years
of his life.

396
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,279
Well, not a one-person person.

397
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,859
You really don't think
your other half's out there?

398
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,659
- Or, you know, in here?
- Actually, Rach...

399
00:23:34,765 --> 00:23:36,132
What, there's some
gorgeous women around.

400
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:39,638
Yes, there are, and I'm trying to
sleep with as many as I can.

401
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,176
And you never fail, do you?

402
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,305
You know, they teach the birds
and the bees about me.

403
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:45,879
(Laughing)

404
00:23:45,987 --> 00:23:47,821
Lt'll all change when you meet Miss Right.

405
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,723
And how am I supposed to know
when I do that?

406
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,527
You don't know, not straight away.
It just feels...

407
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,732
warm and comfortable...

408
00:23:56,842 --> 00:24:00,975
and you hang in there and give it a chance,
before you know it, you're like...

409
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,850
"Yeah, this is it. Must be love."

410
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:07,291
- Yeah, I'm with her.
- I'm with her, too. Give me that.

411
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,426
LUCE: I don't agree.

412
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:12,864
I think you know immediately.
You know, as soon as your eyes...

413
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,904
Then everything that happens
from then on, just proves...

414
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:19,382
that you had been right
in that first moment.

415
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:22,685
When you suddenly realized you had
been incomplete and now you are whole.

416
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,631
- Actually, I'm with her, I'd say.
- I'm with her, too.

417
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,103
Sorted. So, who's for pudding?

418
00:24:30,206 --> 00:24:31,505
- Yes.
- No.

419
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,702
- No?
- No.

420
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:36,307
If you think that, you think that
everyone that doesn't have all that...

421
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,619
business is settling for less.

422
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:42,821
- That's not what I'm saying.
- That kind of is what you're saying.

423
00:24:42,931 --> 00:24:44,058
I think she said it a bit nicer.

424
00:24:45,702 --> 00:24:46,863
Trifle?

425
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,802
You look tired, chief.
You have a good day at work?

426
00:24:50,913 --> 00:24:54,010
- Shite. I'm quitting.
- Did you check out flower girl back there?

427
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,382
Made that speech for me.

428
00:24:55,488 --> 00:24:57,959
Later on tonight,
we're gonna fall madly in bed.

429
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,622
- Oh, it's going well for you guys?
- It's going very well.

430
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:04,867
She's a lesbian.

431
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:10,010
Is that right? Cool.

432
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:12,883
You don't think that slightly impedes
your plans for seduction?

433
00:25:13,757 --> 00:25:14,918
Anyone can change teams.

434
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:21,366
Not anyone. I wouldn't...
'Cause, you know... But anyone, I mean...

435
00:25:33,996 --> 00:25:35,487
What are you doing?

436
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,934
- It's gorgeous.
- It's raining.

437
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:45,176
Heck won't come up here.

438
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,646
They say it's subconscious fear
you'll throw yourself off...

439
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:50,626
but he freaks when I go near the edge, too.

440
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:54,858
Sorry about dinner.

441
00:25:56,908 --> 00:25:58,432
I've eaten worse.

442
00:26:00,447 --> 00:26:03,887
- Kind of went off.
- You didn't go off.

443
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,426
You went a little way off.

444
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,128
- You're wet.
- I'm fine.

445
00:26:12,236 --> 00:26:13,933
- And you're cold.
- I'm fine!

446
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,442
- You can have it. Really, you can have it.
- I'm so fine.

447
00:26:16,544 --> 00:26:17,877
- It's fine. Well...
- Okay, now you're cold.

448
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:19,643
Hey, what are you guys up to?

449
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:21,879
Nothing.

450
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,822
Well, Coop wants to play
strip poker or strip Cooper...

451
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:26,830
and I really want him to go home.

452
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:29,330
- Good night.
- See you soon.

453
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,634
- Two.
- Thanks for dinner.

454
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,176
Bye.

455
00:26:34,947 --> 00:26:35,972
Cheers, Coop.

456
00:26:43,196 --> 00:26:45,531
LUCE: Next left.
COOP: It's one option, yes.

457
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:47,935
COOP: How about instead, we just go
straight back to my place?

458
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,564
LUCE: Coop, take the next left.

459
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:54,347
- You all right, Luce?
- Why, 'cause I don't want to shag you?

460
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:59,920
You're welcome not to shag me,
just don't sit in my car all bored like that.

461
00:27:02,968 --> 00:27:04,267
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:06,466
Really.

463
00:27:07,978 --> 00:27:10,312
You've got something on your mind,
that's obvious.

464
00:27:11,918 --> 00:27:15,950
You know what you should do?
You should share with me.

465
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:19,963
Because beneath this rugged exterior...

466
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:22,305
there beats a sensitive soul.

467
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,709
- No, there doesn't.
- No, there doesn't, but tell me anyway.

468
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:30,349
Bet it's a girl thing, no, right?
I mean, it's got to be.

469
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:35,260
It's a hot and horny scene.
It's you and another vagetarian.

470
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:39,504
Come on. Tell Uncle Cooper all about it.
Spare me no detail.

471
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,242
Have you ever met someone and just...

472
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:50,520
- But there was someone else already?
- Yeah, sure.

473
00:27:50,994 --> 00:27:52,361
Hot ones are always taken.

474
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:54,394
- So, what do you do?
- What do I do?

475
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:58,434
I shag them.

476
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,507
Partner is their problem, it's not mine.

477
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,486
Yeah, I think you don't mess
with other couples.

478
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:08,961
Don't cause that pain, ever.

479
00:28:10,098 --> 00:28:12,000
You just face facts that it can't happen...

480
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:17,169
walk away.
Hook up with someone available instead.

481
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:21,312
Well, your place or mine? Come on, let's...
I'm so good in bed.

482
00:28:23,992 --> 00:28:27,021
So, you promise me the whole
matchmaking thing is over, right?

483
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:30,194
Last night was a big success.
They left together.

484
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:33,572
That distant sound you hear
is wedding bells.

485
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:34,976
What, you didn't twig?

486
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:39,684
- Oh, damn, you are so uncool.
- What? Twig what?

487
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:43,695
Well, the thing you didn't know about
Luce is the fact that she's... right here.

488
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:45,596
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hi!

489
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:46,794
- Hello.
- Hi.

490
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,565
Weirdest thing,
we were just talking about you.

491
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,266
Oh, all nice, I hope.

492
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,511
- Oh, sorry. Heck, this is Edie.
- Edie.

493
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,416
- Heck.
- And Rachel.

494
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:58,615
- Rachel.
- Edie.

495
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:01,628
- Luce?
- Good.

496
00:29:01,998 --> 00:29:04,299
- So, Saturday shopping?
- Is right.

497
00:29:04,838 --> 00:29:05,965
Great.

498
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:10,077
Enjoy it. And listen, thanks for dinner.
We should definitely...

499
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,343
- Definitely.
- We will.

500
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:14,582
- Okay. Well, have a nice rest of shop.
- You, too.

501
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,364
So, are you going out tonight,
'cause I was thinking...

502
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,529
Whoa, pussycat.
What the hell was going on there?

503
00:29:23,306 --> 00:29:25,675
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Luce is gay.

504
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,117
- She's gay.
- As a tennis player.

505
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:33,385
Hey, you reckon that's the girlfriend?

506
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:37,831
She's not just heterosexual.
She's, like, Barbie heterosexual.

507
00:29:38,368 --> 00:29:40,601
Oh, hey. How you doing?

508
00:29:40,707 --> 00:29:42,141
We were just talking about you this time.

509
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,645
- Baby, we'll be late for kickoff.
- Oh, there's hours yet.

510
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:45,806
Sport thing, football team.

511
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,321
- Oh, how darling. Isn't that darling?
- Good, well, I hope you win.

512
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,926
- Edie, are you gay?
- Oh, God.

513
00:29:52,396 --> 00:29:56,234
Am I gay? I'm ecstatic.

514
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,499
- And are you two...
- No. We're not.

515
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:02,069
I tried and I tried, but she loves another.

516
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,179
So, I... I'll call you.

517
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:05,447
- Do, 'cause we should definitely...
- Definitely.

518
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,523
- We will.
- We're going that way.

519
00:30:06,791 --> 00:30:09,317
- Yep. Bye again.
- Bye.

520
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:15,736
So, I found out they are not an item.

521
00:30:15,842 --> 00:30:17,911
Yeah, very tactful. Let's pay.

522
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,342
Hi.

523
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,950
- Are you stalking us?
- And why would we do a thing like that?

524
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,926
- We'll be at this till.
- Waving.

525
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,429
- We'll wave back.
- And do.

526
00:30:28,532 --> 00:30:29,591
- Yes.
- Well, we must.

527
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,863
Definitely.

528
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,446
(Suspended from Class
by Camera Obscura)

529
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:07,100
You know if there's a travel section, babe?

530
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:12,942
I like this jam.

531
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:15,588
It's really good jam.

532
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,322
I should make jam.

533
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,059
- I could make it, you know.
- 'Course you could.

534
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:26,403
- You don't think I could.
- Not for a second.

535
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:28,377
Anyway, I was talking to Rob yesterday.

536
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,316
- That man's an arse.
- That man is an arse.

537
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,914
But he's got this really sweet girlfriend.

538
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:36,292
God knows what she found
to love about him, but she does.

539
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:37,922
He cheats on her like a nutter.

540
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,130
- Oh, come back to bed.
- I'm up now.

541
00:31:42,844 --> 00:31:43,937
Does she know?

542
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,981
Well, I'm like,
"If you wanna leave, tell her."

543
00:31:48,487 --> 00:31:51,323
- You're really up?
- I really am.

544
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:53,957
Maybe he doesn't want to leave.

545
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:56,633
Maybe he doesn't know what he wants.

546
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:59,000
Anyway, he should figure it out
before someone gets hurt.

547
00:32:01,913 --> 00:32:03,109
Why are you looking at me?

548
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,380
'Cause you're a good person.

549
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,783
You wait till I make jam,
then I'll rock your world.

550
00:32:12,702 --> 00:32:15,171
LUCE: What about a bit more color
in there? I've got some lovely lilac.

551
00:32:15,272 --> 00:32:16,832
Oh, why not?

552
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,912
They're for my boyfriend.

553
00:32:20,682 --> 00:32:24,247
- I'm gonna tell him we're having a baby.
- That's great.

554
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,819
(Stuttering) I think so.
He will, too. He definitely will.

555
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,031
He's a bit of a control freak.

556
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:32,901
I'm surprised he doesn't wear
the diaphragm.

557
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:36,638
He's...

558
00:32:37,349 --> 00:32:38,339
He's gonna hate me.

559
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,419
He's gonna hate me.

560
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:49,435
I love him so much.

561
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:51,474
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
He sounds wonderful.

562
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:52,908
I didn't...

563
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,139
(Sobbing hysterically)

564
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:55,238
(Phone ringing)

565
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,322
- I don't know what to do.
- I should...

566
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,483
If you'll just let me...

567
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:01,618
(Continues sobbing)

568
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,028
Flowered Up.

569
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,862
Yes, I can do delivery.

570
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,099
Right now? No, it's no problem.

571
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:10,167
Hi.

572
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,872
I was told to deliver these to Table 7.

573
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,883
Oh, certainly. It's through there.

574
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:18,651
(People chattering)

575
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,064
(Luce chuckling)

576
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:29,845
- Cute, huh?
- Very cute.

577
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:32,820
Fuck me if I'm wrong,
but I think you want to kiss me.

578
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:35,485
Coop, you and me...

579
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:37,998
it's not gonna happen.

580
00:33:38,834 --> 00:33:39,802
It's not?

581
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:41,928
I'll be your friend.

582
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:44,468
Well, that'll do...

583
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:48,619
for now.

584
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:55,656
(Children yelling)

585
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,603
TESSA: Really.
My daughter's school presentation.

586
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:00,800
You should've let me get T-shirts made.

587
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,813
RACHEL: It's not really that kind of deal.

588
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,715
Probably a blessing. Your father
doesn't have the body for them.

589
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,755
'Course I'm just speaking from memory.

590
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:10,294
- Hi.
- Lucy, darling, what are you doing here?

591
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:11,830
I helped H with her...

592
00:34:11,932 --> 00:34:14,926
- Well, she invited me, so...
- Henrietta's ready to start now.

593
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:18,910
H: This is space.
Space is many light years away.

594
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:23,214
Light years are not measured in days
or months, but in kilometers.

595
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:27,084
There's a good reason for this,
but I don't quite understand it yet.

596
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:29,791
This bit is the Milky Way.

597
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:33,594
It's made up of lots of stars
and lots of celestial phenona...

598
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:37,238
Phenona... Phenonema.

599
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,610
One of the best constellations
is Ursa Major...

600
00:34:41,723 --> 00:34:43,692
which is Latin American for Big Bear.

601
00:34:45,062 --> 00:34:47,533
It's called that
because one day in the olden times...

602
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,194
that never really happened...

603
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:52,708
a naughty god called Zeus wanted to go to
bed with someone he wasn't married to.

604
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,077
His wife was about to catch him
and be very cross...

605
00:34:56,184 --> 00:34:58,950
so Zeus turned his girlfriend into a bear.

606
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,754
But Mrs. Zeus...

607
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,381
And that's everything
you need to know about space.

608
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:24,402
(Bell ringing)

609
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:27,233
- So good.
- Very good.

610
00:35:27,945 --> 00:35:29,847
You have to go, right?

611
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:32,783
But I don't. I'm okay.

612
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,659
Luce, I...

613
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:37,394
(Children chattering)

614
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:42,802
I think that we should talk
about something that...

615
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:48,110
- It's just, I don't know. When I'm with...
- Yeah, I do have to go.

616
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:51,354
Actually, I've just realized
I've got a delivery.

617
00:35:51,457 --> 00:35:52,584
Oh, yeah, right.

618
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:54,730
You go.

619
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,225
Yeah.

620
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:01,567
Listen to this.

621
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,238
"In her acceptance speech,
the distinguished scientist...

622
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,287
"paid tribute to her husband,
Dr. Chris Davis." Spelled wrong.

623
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:09,882
"Tomorrow the pair celebrate
their 42nd wedding anniversary...

624
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:12,556
"after eloping together
on the day they met.

625
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:15,068
"When asked how they could possibly
have known it would all work out...

626
00:36:15,171 --> 00:36:17,368
"Professor Harrison... Professor...

627
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:20,002
"replied in true scientific fashion...

628
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:24,451
"'You don't know. You can never be sure.
But you take the plunge anyway.

629
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,451
"'Sure is for people
who don't love enough."'

630
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,756
BOTH: Aw.

631
00:36:29,698 --> 00:36:33,034
- Do you guys believe in love at first sight?
- Well, it saves time.

632
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:40,241
No. Really, that you could meet
someone, or just...

633
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,178
across a room...

634
00:36:43,625 --> 00:36:46,289
and with that one glance you could
look in their eyes and see their soul.

635
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:48,461
Do you believe that could happen?

636
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:53,939
- No.
- Absolutely not.

637
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:56,809
No. Me, neither.

638
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,199
TERRl: These are due back Thursday.

639
00:37:05,301 --> 00:37:07,931
If we're closed,
just pop them through the door. Enjoy.

640
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,066
MAN: Thanks a lot.
TERRl: Thanks.

641
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:14,308
Hi. These, please.

642
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,671
(Clearing throat)

643
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,371
And this as well.

644
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,594
It's just... It's for research.

645
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:42,532
Call it what you want, darling.

646
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:46,745
- It's actually out.
- Oh, that's okay.

647
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,213
- It doesn't matter...
- Although, it's due back.

648
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:49,945
- I'll give them a call.
- Oh, no, honestly...

649
00:37:50,053 --> 00:37:52,489
Babe, trust me. This one you wanna see.

650
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:56,794
Hello, Cas?
Yeah, it's Terri from the vid shop.

651
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,502
Thought it was you.

652
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,008
- Mum.
- I was just dropping by...

653
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,339
with the wedding snaps.

654
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,746
Though, I tell you,
that photographer should be sacked.

655
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,347
He made me look like a thug.
A thug in lilac.

656
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,827
- Anything good?
- No, no.

657
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,561
There's a lady here needs your copy
of Georgie's Bush.

658
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,477
- Georgie's Bush?
- It's for research.

659
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:21,877
It's for Heck.

660
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:24,285
He's very interested in American politics.

661
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,514
TERRl: She's bringing it round.

662
00:38:25,622 --> 00:38:27,991
TESSA: Well, I call that very sexy.

663
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,062
Hmm?

664
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,394
Wouldn't kick him out of bed
for eating crackers, would you?

665
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:34,699
Whoa.

666
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:39,504
WOMAN: Oh, Georgie! Oh!
GEORGIE: Call me Mrs. President.

667
00:38:39,615 --> 00:38:40,605
(Women moaning)

668
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,051
HECK: Babe, are you home?

669
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,751
"You have won a share of ? million."

670
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:46,421
Excellent.

671
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:49,966
- Oh, you are home.
- Hi.

672
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,530
Oh, God. Am I glad to see you.

673
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,372
The morning I've had.
I just had to get away, you know?

674
00:38:59,855 --> 00:39:02,190
- Shall I burn some lunch?
- Please.

675
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,524
Hey, you got some vids.

676
00:39:04,664 --> 00:39:06,930
- Yeah, don't bother looking. I just got...
- This one's great.

677
00:39:07,036 --> 00:39:09,437
This one's pants, but whatever.

678
00:39:11,677 --> 00:39:14,205
And here's one I haven't seen before.

679
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,978
Which, are you...

680
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:18,850
(Exclaiming)

681
00:39:19,995 --> 00:39:22,990
They gave me the wrong one. That...
Oh, my God! That...

682
00:39:23,101 --> 00:39:25,434
The woman at the video store.

683
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:29,076
- I'll take it back.
- Yeah, take it back. That's excellent, yeah.

684
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:32,641
I mean, what, it's porn, right?
It's degrading.

685
00:39:32,753 --> 00:39:33,981
- It's offensive.
- God, yes.

686
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:36,080
Yeah. Let's watch it anyway.

687
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,718
Come on, Rach, I mean,
things have been getting...

688
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:40,824
a bit slack in that department recently.

689
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:44,397
- I know it's my fault and it's... Yeah.
- No, it's mine. I...

690
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,540
But I don't wanna watch this.

691
00:39:47,748 --> 00:39:50,149
- Why?
- It doesn't turn me on.

692
00:39:56,165 --> 00:39:57,496
Makes one of us.

693
00:39:58,336 --> 00:39:59,804
(Crowd chattering)

694
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,987
I love the smell of hot dog in the evening.

695
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:11,817
Smells like...

696
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,001
- hot dog.
- Yeah.

697
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:18,871
The thing is, Ned,
what I wanted to ask was...

698
00:40:18,974 --> 00:40:22,311
- Two, please.
- I was just wondering if it was a bit...

699
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:25,284
odd for you guys,
you know, after you got married?

700
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:28,849
If the interplay between you two...

701
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,954
got a bit...

702
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:32,557
- clutchy?
- Do you want onions?

703
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:34,069
No, thanks.

704
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:36,870
- Because what I'm finding...
- Mustard? Ketchup?

705
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,381
- I can recommend both.
- No, I'm trying to talk to you here.

706
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:44,445
- Oh? What about, dear boy?
- Well, it's just... I'm just... Well...

707
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,757
I'm finding it a bit tricky at the moment
with Rachel...

708
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:50,198
Oh, God, you mustn't discuss her with me.
Never do that.

709
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:51,771
- Sorry?
- Well, that's our problem, you see.

710
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,846
Two of us,
we can be most pleasant to each other...

711
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:58,715
talk of sport or weather
till our throats hurt.

712
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:00,948
- Yeah, yeah.
- Never mention Rachel.

713
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,620
As soon as you do,
the only concrete thought...

714
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:04,958
running through my mind is...

715
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:07,999
that hound is putting it up my daughter.

716
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:14,649
Rach.

717
00:41:16,253 --> 00:41:17,744
(Crowd cheering)

718
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:28,901
TESSA: Darling, I don't know
what to do about your father.

719
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:30,877
He's never been
the last of the red hot lovers...

720
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:34,887
but, recently, it's got to the point
where he's jealous of stiff wind.

721
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:36,014
HECK: Hey, you guys.

722
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:38,618
- Thank God you're here.
- You have no idea.

723
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,789
Good. Got you both.

724
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:42,061
Now, how are my grandchildren
coming along?

725
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,433
Could you get me away from her, please?

726
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:45,008
Just hinting, darling.

727
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:49,115
One wants to have them while
one's still young enough to pick them up.

728
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:52,382
(Exclaiming)

729
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,505
You know, what I do with your parents
is remind myself...

730
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:04,204
that if it wasn't for them,
I wouldn't have you.

731
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:14,690
What's up, baby?

732
00:42:16,469 --> 00:42:17,436
Let's go home.

733
00:42:18,673 --> 00:42:21,735
Now, remember,
try not to look like you're my child, okay?

734
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,781
Because it puts men off.

735
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:26,582
But keep your eyes peeled,
and if you spot anyone, you think...

736
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:28,624
- you know, "Well, he looks nice..."
- Hi.

737
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:30,855
- Luce!
- Hey, hey.

738
00:42:30,964 --> 00:42:34,402
- How you doing?
- This is my friend, Beth. She's on her own.

739
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,701
Now you've found a friend, can I go home?

740
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:37,969
No.

741
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:40,206
- Trying to find her a man.
- There aren't any.

742
00:42:40,315 --> 00:42:42,684
Trust me, I've looked. Oh, careful.

743
00:42:42,787 --> 00:42:45,656
- Sorry, Mrs...
- Don't call me "Mrs."

744
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:50,225
Hello.

745
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:51,529
All right?

746
00:42:58,685 --> 00:42:59,652
Brilliant.

747
00:43:02,024 --> 00:43:05,986
LUCE: (Singing) You've got a boyfriend
You've got a boyfriend

748
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:08,193
No, I haven't. Not yet.

749
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:12,473
I can't wait till you get a boyfriend.

750
00:43:12,578 --> 00:43:15,948
- You probably can, actually.
- You could even get a husband.

751
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,953
You're old enough. Find one like Heck.

752
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:21,959
H, I should explain something to you.

753
00:43:22,062 --> 00:43:25,626
I do believe I will be with one person
for the rest of my life...

754
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:28,173
but that person will be a woman.

755
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:30,034
I understand.

756
00:43:30,979 --> 00:43:31,948
You do?

757
00:43:32,316 --> 00:43:34,342
My best friend is Natalie Curtis.

758
00:43:34,453 --> 00:43:37,220
I'd rather spend the rest of my life
with her than any boy.

759
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:38,883
There you go.

760
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:42,961
It doesn't mean
that you're a lesbian or anything.

761
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,371
H: Come on, let's go.

762
00:43:48,514 --> 00:43:49,777
(Humming)

763
00:43:50,986 --> 00:43:53,718
- I'll put the kettle on, babe.
- I'll have a beer instead.

764
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:55,583
Really?

765
00:43:57,664 --> 00:44:00,465
- I was gonna offer, but...
- But what?

766
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,064
Rach, are you pregnant?

767
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,019
No. No, I'm not, no.

768
00:44:10,156 --> 00:44:11,920
I just thought
it might explain your recent...

769
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:16,430
Whatever. Nothing.

770
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:23,475
Unless...

771
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:26,074
Unless what?

772
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,720
Mmm.

773
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:32,721
Do you want to get pregnant?

774
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:35,936
You and my mum.

775
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,776
Listen, I know we said
we were going to wait...

776
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,544
but until what,
you know, we're even more settled?

777
00:44:43,487 --> 00:44:44,477
Come on, what do you think?

778
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,294
(Cell phone ringing)

779
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,007
I got to take it.

780
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:56,805
Rob, hey, what's up?

781
00:44:58,817 --> 00:45:00,046
No, I've a minute.

782
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,723
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They're in my briefcase, hang on.

783
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:16,014
(Children laughing)

784
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:17,584
(Cell phone ringing)

785
00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:22,223
Hello.

786
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,759
Hello.

787
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:33,882
Hey, gorgeous.

788
00:45:33,985 --> 00:45:37,948
That was Rob.
Look, I'm really sorry about this but...

789
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:42,931
No, of course you should still go.

790
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:46,769
You know, I wouldn't put you through
my evening for all the coke in Colombia.

791
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:49,711
You know, it'll be the usual bollocks,
everyone will get pissed.

792
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:50,839
I'll get pissed...

793
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:51,918
(Phone ringing)

794
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,456
And start singing country and western
songs badly like I always do.

795
00:45:54,558 --> 00:45:55,651
Hello?

796
00:45:56,193 --> 00:46:00,065
- Heck, it's Luce.
- Hey, Luce. How's it going?

797
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,371
It's Luce. What's up?

798
00:46:02,807 --> 00:46:05,073
Nothing. My phone just rang and...

799
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:08,150
Sorry, you busy Tuesday night?

800
00:46:08,686 --> 00:46:10,085
Do you fancy
escorting my wife somewhere?

801
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:13,683
It's just, like, I've got this
wanky work thing which I can't get out of.

802
00:46:13,795 --> 00:46:16,095
You know, it'll be really great
if you could look after Rach for me.

803
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,395
Go on, say yes. Go on.

804
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:19,995
- Then, yes.
- Brilliant. Brilliant.

805
00:46:20,609 --> 00:46:23,546
Well, Rach will ring you with the details...

806
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:25,640
and be safe.

807
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:27,119
You, too.

808
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:32,864
You shouldn't have done that.
I hardly know her.

809
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:34,558
Yeah, but she's your...

810
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:38,263
soul-mate-for-life type thing.
You'll have a belter.

811
00:46:38,376 --> 00:46:39,344
Beer.

812
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,917
Does she know where we're going?

813
00:46:44,154 --> 00:46:45,144
(Crowd yelling)

814
00:46:45,255 --> 00:46:48,717
Go on, hound him!
Hound his legs, chop him!

815
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,400
- Over there!
- On the left side!

816
00:46:54,473 --> 00:46:56,967
- You know, you're kind of shrill.
- What?

817
00:46:57,078 --> 00:46:58,809
When you shout.

818
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,408
You want them to hear your abuse better,
you've got to project it.

819
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:05,992
- Teach me.
- Okay.

820
00:47:06,096 --> 00:47:08,567
First off, tighten your stomach muscles.

821
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:11,298
- I don't think I've got any.
- Yeah, you do.

822
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:13,638
- You really do. They're right here.
- There?

823
00:47:13,744 --> 00:47:14,734
Mmm-hmm.

824
00:47:14,846 --> 00:47:16,509
- Tighten.
- Tighten.

825
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,475
- Tense them.
- They're pretty tense.

826
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,114
Okay, next, broaden your diaphragm.

827
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:24,386
- My what?
- It's here.

828
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,602
Oh.

829
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:29,303
Okay, push it out against my hand.

830
00:47:31,244 --> 00:47:32,873
You feel my hand?

831
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,678
Maybe if you put them both there.

832
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:44,268
Okay.

833
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,538
And now, for the big one.

834
00:47:48,044 --> 00:47:50,913
Imagine the roof of your mouth
is a cathedral.

835
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,256
- No, you've lost me.
- Oh, come on.

836
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:57,351
No, the muscles,
the diaphragm, I'm there, but...

837
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:58,623
It's a space thing.

838
00:47:58,732 --> 00:48:02,569
All right, your mouth is that big
that you have to fill it with sound.

839
00:48:02,772 --> 00:48:06,146
Deep from inside, filling the space,
then throwing it out.

840
00:48:07,548 --> 00:48:08,778
Like how?

841
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:10,451
(Crowd yelling)

842
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:11,749
Like this.

843
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:17,432
(Echoing loudly) You're a wanker,
Number 9!

844
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,070
RACHEL: That's not bad, is it?
LUCE: No.

845
00:48:24,581 --> 00:48:26,950
RACHEL: All right, so your turn.
Where do you want to go?

846
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:28,988
I don't care where we go.

847
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,116
Good. I'll decide again.

848
00:48:31,294 --> 00:48:32,557
Okay.

849
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:34,165
I feel like dancing.

850
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:37,463
Boom. Hold that thought.

851
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:40,177
What? What, you know somewhere
we should go?

852
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:41,303
Got an idea.

853
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,047
MALE VOICE: (On arcade machine)
Let's begin the dancing.

854
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,692
(Feels Like I'm in Love
by Kelly Marie playing)

855
00:48:50,832 --> 00:48:53,029
MALE VOICE: Disco, disco, disco.

856
00:48:56,242 --> 00:48:58,440
Okay, do the dog kick.

857
00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:01,150
(Both laughing)

858
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,318
Now we are talking boogie.

859
00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:09,526
(Both sighing)

860
00:49:12,774 --> 00:49:16,236
Yeah, that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh.

861
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,690
I know what I like,
and I am liking what I see.

862
00:49:30,543 --> 00:49:31,840
You guys rule!

863
00:49:33,147 --> 00:49:36,415
- All right, more.
- Tell me about the lily.

864
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:40,048
- You don't want to know about the lily.
- It's my favorite.

865
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:44,968
Ask me about the azalea.

866
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:49,568
All right. What about the azalea?

867
00:49:49,813 --> 00:49:52,979
The azalea means,
"May you achieve financial security."

868
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:54,955
- Bah.
- See?

869
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:56,024
(Giggling)

870
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:59,697
Lovely. Now, tell me about the lily.

871
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,030
The lily means...

872
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:07,679
The lily means, "I dare you to love me."

873
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,992
Well, thanks for this evening.

874
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,666
- Thank you.
- It was my birthday.

875
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:25,069
No, today? You should've said.

876
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:28,483
- It's mine coming up.
- We're practically twins.

877
00:50:30,892 --> 00:50:32,452
This is me.

878
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:39,133
I...

879
00:50:40,143 --> 00:50:41,703
Okay, good night.

880
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:43,708
Yeah.

881
00:50:44,485 --> 00:50:45,818
Night.

882
00:50:50,463 --> 00:50:51,693
(Sighing)

883
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:04,689
(Breathes deeply)

884
00:51:07,061 --> 00:51:08,462
Your feet.

885
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:12,897
- Are they cold?
- No, stinking.

886
00:51:13,108 --> 00:51:14,507
(Chuckling)

887
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:16,938
Yes, of course, they're cold.

888
00:51:17,715 --> 00:51:19,150
Come here.

889
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:34,273
COOP: You fancy coming round mine
tonight, or are you too married?

890
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,010
HECK: Actually, Rach wants to
take me to dinner.

891
00:51:36,653 --> 00:51:39,123
Just phoned me up
and wants to take me to dinner...

892
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,559
- which is sweet.
- Very sweet.

893
00:51:41,662 --> 00:51:42,892
Yeah.

894
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:45,196
Blow her off. Come round mine for pizza.

895
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:48,207
Really, no, I want you to meet
the Italian girl that delivers it.

896
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:51,406
What about that flower girl, Luce?
I thought you had plans there.

897
00:51:51,515 --> 00:51:53,484
There's another one
that won't let me get it wet.

898
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:54,553
She's gay.

899
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,090
- I'm a cure for lesbianism.
- No, you're a deeply shallow man.

900
00:51:57,192 --> 00:51:58,456
Yes, I am.

901
00:51:58,562 --> 00:51:59,723
When's it gonna stop?

902
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:02,859
- Never, I hope.
- God bless you.

903
00:52:05,642 --> 00:52:08,341
Really, though, you know, I'm 29 years old.

904
00:52:08,447 --> 00:52:11,009
- You're 31.
- Precisely my point. I'm getting older.

905
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:14,921
And I see you...

906
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,852
I see what you've got with...

907
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:19,958
I can see that stability.

908
00:52:21,407 --> 00:52:24,173
And the trust, and permanence.

909
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:26,774
And I think...

910
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,483
"God, I'm glad I'm not you."

911
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,256
(People chattering)

912
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,656
Actually things don't feel
totally 100% stable at the moment.

913
00:52:34,899 --> 00:52:36,162
You got trouble in paradise?

914
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,964
No, no, no.

915
00:52:40,443 --> 00:52:41,934
How could there be?
We only just got married.

916
00:52:42,413 --> 00:52:43,746
That's all it... All it is, isn't it?

917
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,409
WOMAN: Millie! Millie, darling.

918
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,614
MILLIE: I'm sorry I'm late.

919
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:49,317
- Coop.
- Don't move.

920
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:51,997
- What?
- No, there's just...

921
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,868
a girl back there that I never called back.
Just stay perfectly still, okay?

922
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,865
We'll get through this.

923
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:03,050
(Water running)

924
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:08,859
Did you ever, you know...

925
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:10,194
cross the street?

926
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,359
WOMAN: That depends.

927
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:14,967
- On what?
- On what the hell you're talking about.

928
00:53:15,912 --> 00:53:18,075
- Drink after work tonight?
- Dinner with Heck.

929
00:53:19,987 --> 00:53:22,321
I mean, did you ever...

930
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:25,987
fancy, or think you might've briefly
before you realized you didn't...

931
00:53:26,098 --> 00:53:29,559
- another woman?
- Why?

932
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,644
I'm trying to find someone for Beth,
and I thought I'd double my chances.

933
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:35,146
(Gargling)

934
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,450
Already tried it. It didn't happen for me.

935
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:39,957
I like men.

936
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:42,660
I mean, I hate men, but, you know.

937
00:53:43,131 --> 00:53:45,158
I always hoped to do a woman
before I died.

938
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:46,865
But it's kind of like...

939
00:53:46,971 --> 00:53:49,100
I want to go to Norway sometime.
Do you know what I mean?

940
00:53:49,877 --> 00:53:51,210
Probably never gonna happen.

941
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:56,586
- So Heck's taking you to dinner?
- I'm taking him.

942
00:53:58,661 --> 00:53:59,992
How perfect.

943
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:04,769
(Car horn honking)

944
00:54:09,816 --> 00:54:10,806
That was fun.

945
00:54:12,455 --> 00:54:13,423
Wasn't it fun?

946
00:54:14,526 --> 00:54:15,823
Had a good time.

947
00:54:18,432 --> 00:54:20,698
- You know, Rach, I think...
- Hey, the heath!

948
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,968
You remember that night
you took me in the bushes?

949
00:54:23,609 --> 00:54:26,079
- I never took you in the bushes.
- Sorry, wrong guy.

950
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,150
I took you up against a tree.

951
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:31,189
I can't be dealing with bushes, nettles,
and deadly nightshade.

952
00:54:31,291 --> 00:54:33,420
- Let's do it.
- What?

953
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:35,795
- Let's go. Let's do it now.
- No.

954
00:54:37,102 --> 00:54:38,468
Rach, no.

955
00:54:41,043 --> 00:54:42,068
HECK: Rach.

956
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:44,943
Rach, where are you?

957
00:54:45,885 --> 00:54:46,875
Come on, darling.

958
00:54:46,987 --> 00:54:48,012
(Laughing nervously)

959
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:49,112
Rachel!

960
00:54:50,026 --> 00:54:52,897
I just, I just don't understand
why we have to do this stuff anymore.

961
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,097
You know, we've got a flat.
It's a good one.

962
00:54:56,572 --> 00:54:59,909
And I've confiscated your mother's key,
so she can't sneak up on us anymore.

963
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,575
And I swear that woman's got a sex radar.

964
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,814
We've got a bed, you know.
Warm, it's welcoming...

965
00:55:04,922 --> 00:55:07,051
it smells nice, it's a damn sight better
than this arsing place.

966
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:08,149
(Rachel growling)

967
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:09,388
Jesus Christ.

968
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:13,362
- Did I scare you?
- No. Nettles everywhere.

969
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:15,500
- What are you doing?
- Taking off your clothes.

970
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,546
Actually, it's one of the great things
about being a man.

971
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,116
You can do these things
without stripping off.

972
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:22,211
Just a zip. Simple zip is all you need.

973
00:55:22,323 --> 00:55:24,589
Give it a yank,
and you're well away, darling.

974
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:28,156
- You gonna talk all through this?
- Did I mention we have a bed?

975
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:31,362
(Wings flapping)

976
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:33,238
- What was that?
- What?

977
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,944
Nothing. Nothing.

978
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:40,186
(Leaves rustling)

979
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:44,159
All right, whoever is behind there...

980
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,201
come out before we beat
the crap out of you.

981
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:47,999
Yeah, damn it.

982
00:55:50,545 --> 00:55:51,774
Terribly sorry.

983
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:53,040
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

984
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:54,549
Oh, God.

985
00:55:54,853 --> 00:55:57,824
- We were trying not to disturb you.
- That's fine, really.

986
00:55:57,925 --> 00:56:00,192
Disturb us? No. No, you didn't disturb us.

987
00:56:00,297 --> 00:56:03,166
- We, we... We were just, you know.
- So were we.

988
00:56:03,268 --> 00:56:04,258
(Rachel giggling)

989
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:07,206
So, you think we were...
No, and we're married.

990
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:09,108
And we have a bed.

991
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:11,642
- I'm Heck, by the way.
- Michael.

992
00:56:11,752 --> 00:56:12,913
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

993
00:56:13,021 --> 00:56:14,751
- Michael, too.
- Oh, really.

994
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:16,259
I'm Rachel.

995
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:18,023
It was lovely to meet you two chaps.

996
00:56:20,068 --> 00:56:21,263
(Heck sighing)

997
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:25,073
- Must be very nice to be married.
- We only just met this evening.

998
00:56:26,915 --> 00:56:28,474
Yeah, sometimes I feel like we did, too.

999
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:56,497
- Hi.
- No, no, you're not happy to see...

1000
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:58,575
You can't.
I don't want you to be happy to see me.

1001
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:00,009
- Okay.
- Okay.

1002
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:02,810
So, I'm here because
I don't know what's going on.

1003
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:03,976
I don't.

1004
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:07,617
You make me feel something.
Something I absolutely cannot feel.

1005
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:09,093
I'm married.

1006
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:12,327
I'm married, for Christ's sake.
I have a husband, this...

1007
00:57:12,469 --> 00:57:16,465
man that I... This lovely guy.
He's done nothing wrong.

1008
00:57:16,577 --> 00:57:18,308
I was wondering if you could help me?

1009
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:20,441
I'm hoping to start a herb garden.

1010
00:57:20,551 --> 00:57:22,488
MAN: It's a pretty little corner space...

1011
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:25,321
- north, right?
- These, these. On the house. Go.

1012
00:57:30,103 --> 00:57:32,700
Okay, so do you see? You have to see.

1013
00:57:32,808 --> 00:57:35,371
I can't do this. I can't actually do this.

1014
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,385
So whatever it is or was,
it's got to stop, and it's got to stop now.

1015
00:57:38,487 --> 00:57:39,477
Do you understand?

1016
00:57:40,189 --> 00:57:41,248
It's over.

1017
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:22,261
Ow!

1018
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:24,842
- What, what?
- Thorns in my bum.

1019
00:58:24,943 --> 00:58:26,104
(Rachel grunting)

1020
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:28,774
(Both giggling)

1021
00:58:30,954 --> 00:58:31,980
I'm sorry.

1022
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:34,189
(Door opening)

1023
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,426
It's another customer.

1024
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:40,795
(Both giggling)

1025
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:42,604
HECK: Hello?

1026
00:58:46,951 --> 00:58:48,146
Luce?

1027
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:52,251
Luce, you in the back?

1028
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:55,692
Don't come in, Heck, I...

1029
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,342
I was stock taking.

1030
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:03,542
You know, counting the...

1031
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:07,149
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

1032
00:59:09,129 --> 00:59:10,324
What do you want, Heck?

1033
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:13,532
Buy some flowers. What else?

1034
00:59:14,939 --> 00:59:18,709
- Flowers, of course.
- Not for me, for my wife, Rachel.

1035
00:59:19,615 --> 00:59:21,174
HECK: Recently, she's just been a bit...

1036
00:59:22,054 --> 00:59:23,044
I don't know.

1037
00:59:23,255 --> 00:59:24,224
But you know what they say...

1038
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:26,089
there's nothing quite so cheering
as a well-timed bloom.

1039
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:28,623
So, I thought
one of your finest arrangements.

1040
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:29,722
Absolutely.

1041
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,830
- What does she like?
- You know what she likes.

1042
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:37,581
Lilies. She likes lilies.

1043
00:59:39,386 --> 00:59:42,791
- Lilies? Right, well, that's simple.
- Yeah.

1044
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,632
So, did you enjoy the football
the other night?

1045
00:59:45,732 --> 00:59:47,566
It was an experience.

1046
00:59:47,703 --> 00:59:49,034
(Heck chuckling)

1047
00:59:49,373 --> 00:59:51,741
How did you find Rachel?

1048
00:59:53,581 --> 00:59:55,710
Fine. I mean, I wouldn't...

1049
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,883
Fine.

1050
00:59:58,723 --> 01:00:00,283
I don't suppose she...

1051
01:00:01,095 --> 01:00:02,927
No. Well...

1052
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,597
I was just wondering
if she said anything about...

1053
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:07,140
me or...

1054
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:08,473
me or...

1055
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,990
I just think I'm doing something wrong,
is all.

1056
01:00:17,093 --> 01:00:18,118
I mean, that's what I think.

1057
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:20,923
HECK: And if she said what it is...

1058
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:25,305
that I'm doing, or not doing,
then I can stop it.

1059
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:28,680
Or start, or whatever, you see.

1060
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,109
And then we can...

1061
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:32,689
Like before.

1062
01:00:34,026 --> 01:00:35,620
We can get back to being like before.

1063
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,363
- She didn't say anything.
- No.

1064
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:43,498
And I've embarrassed you.

1065
01:00:44,412 --> 01:00:48,113
And myself, which is normal, very normal.

1066
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:51,086
- These are beautiful. How much do I...
- No, they're on the house.

1067
01:00:52,929 --> 01:00:54,089
Thanks.

1068
01:00:56,102 --> 01:00:59,131
You should ask her, you know. Not me.

1069
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:02,472
Bless you, but...

1070
01:01:03,082 --> 01:01:05,075
I can't ask Rachel
if there's anything wrong.

1071
01:01:05,186 --> 01:01:07,383
I mean, that's way too scary.

1072
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:09,284
Why?

1073
01:01:11,933 --> 01:01:12,900
What if there is?

1074
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,535
Thanks.

1075
01:01:35,778 --> 01:01:36,939
Rachel!

1076
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:39,117
- Rachel, wait!
- Luce, please!

1077
01:01:39,219 --> 01:01:41,553
- Just talk to me.
- What do you want me to say?

1078
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,856
I heard him.
Jesus, I'm lying there, and I heard him...

1079
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:46,397
and he's blaming himself.

1080
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,093
You can put an end to this.

1081
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:49,534
- How?
- Tell me to go.

1082
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:55,881
Tell me that's what you want,
and I will walk away...

1083
01:01:55,984 --> 01:01:56,975
and you will never see me again.

1084
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,427
Is that what you want?

1085
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,469
I want you.

1086
01:02:12,115 --> 01:02:13,208
Luce.

1087
01:02:13,986 --> 01:02:15,214
I know.

1088
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:18,048
I can't...

1089
01:02:19,496 --> 01:02:20,657
I know.

1090
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:29,504
We'll be okay.

1091
01:02:34,558 --> 01:02:36,118
Don't forget me.

1092
01:02:38,501 --> 01:02:40,630
I won't remember anything else.

1093
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:25,848
Come on, Jeff, you scratch my back
and I'll kiss your arse.

1094
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:28,290
Okay, can you repeat that, please?

1095
01:03:29,298 --> 01:03:31,164
Okay, 41 flat.

1096
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:34,172
Okay, well, let me just factor that into
the computer and crunch some numbers.

1097
01:03:34,274 --> 01:03:36,802
He can't go any higher.
I mean, he hasn't got it. He can't.

1098
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,108
Yeah, the screen's flashing red
at me here, Jeff.

1099
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:42,689
It's not gonna cut it.
In fact, the figure that I'm reading is...

1100
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:45,988
Yeah, but the figure I'm reading
is forty-one and a half.

1101
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:48,831
That's 41.5. Any lower just can't be a go.

1102
01:03:48,937 --> 01:03:50,964
That's way too much. It's too much.

1103
01:03:51,108 --> 01:03:52,599
(People chattering)

1104
01:03:53,378 --> 01:03:56,476
So let's do it, Jeff. Let's work our way up.
Give me 41.1. Give me that.

1105
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:58,452
We're feeling no pain there,
and you know what?

1106
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:01,686
If we're at 0.1, let's have some fun.
Let's double down.

1107
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:04,163
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

1108
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,465
All right, keep on coming.

1109
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:12,706
Keep on coming. Give me three, three is
well in. You give me that right now...

1110
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,514
You will?
Well, then go one more. Go to four.

1111
01:04:15,622 --> 01:04:18,218
I really, really, really don't wanna do it.

1112
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:21,821
(Sighing)

1113
01:04:21,934 --> 01:04:23,994
Yeah, yeah. Jeff, you know,
don't take that tone with me.

1114
01:04:24,105 --> 01:04:26,871
You know, I'm giving you a chance here.
Now, do you wanna be a big dog...

1115
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:28,570
or do you wanna play on the porch
with the puppies?

1116
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,584
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I feel that.
Okay, last one, my friend.

1117
01:04:31,686 --> 01:04:34,486
Over the cliff. I'm holding your hand,
I'm cupping your balls.

1118
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:37,757
I'm there with you, and I'm there for you.
You've gotta ask yourself, Jeffrey...

1119
01:04:37,864 --> 01:04:40,494
do you trust me? Do you trust me?

1120
01:04:43,309 --> 01:04:44,867
Congratulations. We can deal.

1121
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,153
My boy, for that,
you get a bonus as big as my knob.

1122
01:04:51,256 --> 01:04:52,246
Well, screw your bonus.

1123
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:54,294
I wish I could.
Now, where d'you wanna go for a drink?

1124
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:55,625
Screw you, too, Rob.

1125
01:04:57,068 --> 01:04:58,901
Hecky, what is it?

1126
01:04:59,139 --> 01:05:02,510
It just... It makes me sick, you know.
You lie. You just lie.

1127
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,177
Well, so do you.

1128
01:05:08,557 --> 01:05:09,525
Not anymore.

1129
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:17,464
Heck. Hecky. Hecky, come back!

1130
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:25,249
- Hi.
- Afternoon.

1131
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:28,791
I'm looking for a breakup plant.

1132
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:31,230
- A what?
- A breakup plant.

1133
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:32,563
Explain.

1134
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:35,539
Well, I don't like my girlfriend.
I wanna break up with her...

1135
01:05:35,643 --> 01:05:37,509
via the means of plant.

1136
01:05:37,613 --> 01:05:40,847
Well, it should be a breakup bouquet,
and it should be hydrangeas.

1137
01:05:40,954 --> 01:05:43,423
They mean,
"It's over, but think well of me."

1138
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:45,222
Perfect. I'll take one.

1139
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:47,891
- One bouquet?
- One hyer-whatsit.

1140
01:05:48,133 --> 01:05:49,863
But that's not a lot.

1141
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,736
Well, I don't care if she thinks well of me.

1142
01:05:53,344 --> 01:05:54,813
D'you know what? Piss off!

1143
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:56,940
- Pardon?
- Out! Get out of my shop.

1144
01:05:57,051 --> 01:05:59,715
She's well rid of your fat arse, anyway.

1145
01:06:18,592 --> 01:06:20,425
Mum?

1146
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:21,861
ELLA: I'll be right out.

1147
01:06:23,168 --> 01:06:24,728
Take your time.

1148
01:06:38,632 --> 01:06:41,798
Oh, sweet shit in a bucket,
what's wrong with you?

1149
01:06:43,074 --> 01:06:45,407
Blow your nose, then explain.

1150
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:49,283
(Sniffling)

1151
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,910
I met this girl.

1152
01:06:54,061 --> 01:06:55,290
She's with someone else.

1153
01:06:56,566 --> 01:06:57,659
And does she love you?

1154
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:00,740
I don't know.

1155
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,000
No.

1156
01:07:06,953 --> 01:07:08,046
Yes.

1157
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,222
But it doesn't matter.

1158
01:07:13,298 --> 01:07:15,632
Oh, it's all that matters.

1159
01:07:16,905 --> 01:07:18,704
She's with someone else. She can't...

1160
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:23,744
(Sighing)

1161
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:25,983
When Dad left you, he broke your heart.

1162
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:29,589
It mends again.

1163
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:36,635
Look at you, you look fantastic.

1164
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:38,040
(Chuckling)

1165
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,910
I may be older than God,
but I can still make an effort.

1166
01:07:41,352 --> 01:07:44,290
A date? Does my mother have a date?

1167
01:07:45,126 --> 01:07:47,063
I'm going to eat food with a man, yes.

1168
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,355
And how do you feel?

1169
01:07:50,137 --> 01:07:51,264
Oh.

1170
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:56,002
Well, you know,
when you're holding a hot cup of coffee...

1171
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,709
and you realize you're going to sneeze?

1172
01:07:59,053 --> 01:08:00,180
That's how I feel.

1173
01:08:01,825 --> 01:08:03,124
Come here.

1174
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,131
ELLA: Well, yippee.

1175
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:14,510
(Heck singing drunkenly)

1176
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:20,659
Oh, shit. Heck, where have you...

1177
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,527
(Singing)

1178
01:08:27,074 --> 01:08:28,542
Never fails.

1179
01:08:28,645 --> 01:08:32,550
Eight pints of water before bed,
and next day, you feel no pain.

1180
01:08:34,556 --> 01:08:36,253
Are you well, my gorgeous darling?

1181
01:08:37,628 --> 01:08:40,327
- I want to talk to you.
- I want to talk to you, too.

1182
01:08:40,434 --> 01:08:44,430
Just three more of these
and I'm quite literally all ears.

1183
01:08:45,176 --> 01:08:46,166
I'll be waiting.

1184
01:08:46,412 --> 01:08:47,607
Mmm-hmm.

1185
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,083
Very listening.

1186
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,093
Shoot.

1187
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,131
I wanted to talk to you because...

1188
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,946
I have to talk to you
because this thing happened.

1189
01:09:09,422 --> 01:09:11,256
I wasn't looking for it, it just...

1190
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,397
It just happened, and although...

1191
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:17,637
it's over...

1192
01:09:22,749 --> 01:09:23,876
you've a right to know.

1193
01:09:31,932 --> 01:09:33,367
(Sighing)

1194
01:09:37,811 --> 01:09:39,576
I went crazy, Heck.

1195
01:09:45,493 --> 01:09:47,928
I went crazy for someone,
and it wasn't you.

1196
01:09:54,309 --> 01:09:55,608
I'm sorry.

1197
01:10:00,923 --> 01:10:03,052
I'm so very sorry, so...

1198
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,596
please believe me.

1199
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:11,032
Heck?

1200
01:10:13,714 --> 01:10:16,844
No, no, no. Don't sleep. Wake up, Heck.

1201
01:10:17,788 --> 01:10:20,054
I can't say this more than once.

1202
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:24,632
I'm staying.

1203
01:10:28,276 --> 01:10:31,247
I couldn't, wouldn't leave you.

1204
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,886
You are my best friend.

1205
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:42,560
And that was enough before.
It'll be enough again, so...

1206
01:11:08,855 --> 01:11:10,323
(Birds chirping)

1207
01:11:23,047 --> 01:11:24,140
Coop.

1208
01:11:25,553 --> 01:11:28,024
It is you, then, is it?

1209
01:11:29,227 --> 01:11:32,027
- Is what? I don't...
- Heck doesn't know.

1210
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:35,203
He said that she didn't tell who...

1211
01:11:35,506 --> 01:11:37,475
but I figured it out.

1212
01:11:39,947 --> 01:11:40,938
What did he say?

1213
01:11:42,386 --> 01:11:43,649
Just tell me I'm wrong, girl.

1214
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:46,058
Tell me.

1215
01:11:49,266 --> 01:11:50,668
- You dumb slut.
- Don't start, Coop.

1216
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:51,795
- You dumb slut.
- Don't start, Coop.

1217
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:53,865
"Don't start"?

1218
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,844
Her husband, her flipping husband
calls me in the middle of the night.

1219
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:01,285
And you wanna know how he was?
He was busted!

1220
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:02,378
You know, just get out.

1221
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:04,791
What was that thing that you said?
What was that?

1222
01:12:04,896 --> 01:12:06,422
"Never wreck another couple."

1223
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:09,127
You really stuck to that one good,
didn't you?

1224
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,060
(Door slamming)

1225
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:24,030
Okay, then. Okay. Yeah.

1226
01:12:24,635 --> 01:12:26,103
See you. Bye.

1227
01:12:34,619 --> 01:12:36,886
RACHEL: It's wonderful. Thank you.

1228
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:39,588
There's a lovely section
on cooking with your children.

1229
01:12:40,464 --> 01:12:42,697
- Who was on the phone, honey?
- Luce.

1230
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:46,001
She was supposed to take
me and my boyfriend to the museum...

1231
01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:47,099
but now we're not.

1232
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,335
Oh.

1233
01:12:48,446 --> 01:12:49,573
Maybe some other time.

1234
01:12:49,683 --> 01:12:52,484
Not for a while.
She's going on a very long holiday.

1235
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:55,549
She is?

1236
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:57,391
When was the last time
you took me on holiday?

1237
01:12:58,098 --> 01:13:00,935
The summer of '94. Great Barrier Reef.

1238
01:13:01,605 --> 01:13:03,233
You scared all the sharks away.

1239
01:13:04,912 --> 01:13:06,347
She didn't mention that the other night.

1240
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,348
No, yes, she did say something,
I remember now.

1241
01:13:09,455 --> 01:13:12,689
Will you take us to the museum?
And can Heck come, too?

1242
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:14,353
Of course he can.

1243
01:13:14,464 --> 01:13:15,797
Do penguins have knees?

1244
01:13:16,401 --> 01:13:19,862
Well, this is fun, isn't it?
Shame it's only once a year.

1245
01:13:21,344 --> 01:13:23,405
(All singing Happy Birthday)

1246
01:13:32,197 --> 01:13:33,895
- I can't handle this.
- Heck.

1247
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,940
I can't do it, Rachel, I can't do it.
I thought I could, but I can't.

1248
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:40,012
Blow out the candles, darling.

1249
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,476
- What's happening?
- I'm going.

1250
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,712
But it's, it's good cake.

1251
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,485
Your mother got the recipe from the book
before she wrapped it.

1252
01:13:46,592 --> 01:13:48,060
I'm not gonna leave you.

1253
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:50,963
If you respect me at all,
that's exactly what you will do.

1254
01:13:51,068 --> 01:13:52,433
Will you kindly tell me
what you're talking about?

1255
01:13:52,537 --> 01:13:53,870
Why is Heck being sad?

1256
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:56,102
It's not you leaving that's gonna kill me.

1257
01:13:56,913 --> 01:13:58,814
It's you loving someone more.

1258
01:13:59,284 --> 01:14:00,617
Sorry to interrupt you.

1259
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,886
Those candles are dripping wax
all over your mother's creation.

1260
01:14:03,993 --> 01:14:06,054
Will you fuck off with the fucking candles?

1261
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:09,834
Yeah. Yeah.

1262
01:14:13,678 --> 01:14:16,206
No, you're not walking away.
Don't walk away from me.

1263
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:18,914
Yeah, keep saying that.
Let me pretend this is my choice.

1264
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,547
What do you mean?

1265
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:22,958
Oh, come on, Rach, we both know
you'd have left me in the end anyway.

1266
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:24,862
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!

1267
01:14:29,643 --> 01:14:30,611
Yes, it is.

1268
01:14:33,483 --> 01:14:34,747
You know, I want you to be happy.

1269
01:14:35,822 --> 01:14:38,657
More than anything else, I wanted
to be the cause of happiness in you.

1270
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:43,133
But if I'm not, then...

1271
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:46,540
I can't stand in the way.

1272
01:14:47,543 --> 01:14:48,511
Do you see?

1273
01:14:50,583 --> 01:14:53,646
Because what you're feeling now, Rachel...

1274
01:14:56,295 --> 01:14:58,288
is the unstoppable force.

1275
01:15:01,737 --> 01:15:03,263
Which means that I've got to move.

1276
01:15:20,675 --> 01:15:21,664
Darling...

1277
01:15:22,311 --> 01:15:25,977
what did Heck mean when he said
you're in love with someone else?

1278
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:29,356
I am in love with someone else.

1279
01:15:30,427 --> 01:15:34,025
Cooper. That trollop.
He'd shag an open wound.

1280
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:36,665
Not him.

1281
01:15:37,507 --> 01:15:38,840
Who, then?

1282
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:41,407
Well, out with it. What's his name?

1283
01:15:41,515 --> 01:15:42,539
Who is the lucky chap?

1284
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:49,994
Her name is Luce.

1285
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:54,830
- Luce?
- Yes.

1286
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:57,333
Who's a woman.

1287
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:00,477
As are you a woman.

1288
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:02,821
That's right.

1289
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,655
So the two of you are lesbi-friends.

1290
01:16:08,835 --> 01:16:10,804
It doesn't matter what you call it,
it's not going to happen.

1291
01:16:12,374 --> 01:16:14,937
- Not after all this.
- Quite bloody right.

1292
01:16:15,046 --> 01:16:17,608
Could I say something here?

1293
01:16:24,398 --> 01:16:25,867
When I first met your mother...

1294
01:16:27,637 --> 01:16:28,969
back in the Trojan War...

1295
01:16:32,513 --> 01:16:35,747
I fell for her right off the bat.

1296
01:16:38,759 --> 01:16:41,423
And although she loved me back,
she married me...

1297
01:16:43,902 --> 01:16:46,772
somehow I always knew I was...

1298
01:16:49,546 --> 01:16:51,483
never quite up to snuff.

1299
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:57,719
We muddled along,
got through the years...

1300
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:03,773
but I've never doubted that
if she ever met anyone she really fell for...

1301
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:08,011
who made her realize what true love is...

1302
01:17:09,952 --> 01:17:12,218
she'd leave me like a shot...

1303
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:15,926
and how could I argue?

1304
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:21,234
Whatever you choose to do from here...

1305
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:24,436
we'll support you, we always will.

1306
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:27,442
But please, my darling...

1307
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:30,555
follow your heart.

1308
01:17:32,096 --> 01:17:34,896
- Could I borrow your car?
- I'll drive you.

1309
01:17:37,473 --> 01:17:39,101
Nothing happens without me there.

1310
01:17:43,985 --> 01:17:45,317
You coming?

1311
01:17:48,094 --> 01:17:51,554
When we come back,
we'll talk about this if you want to.

1312
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,893
Yeah.

1313
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:56,675
Do you know what I wish?

1314
01:17:57,211 --> 01:17:58,680
That you won't grow up so fast.

1315
01:18:04,825 --> 01:18:06,351
(Car engine whirring)

1316
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:12,296
You take care, then.

1317
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:14,604
You take care. I'm going to enjoy myself.

1318
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:20,352
Hey. You did nothing wrong.

1319
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:25,193
I did. Truth is, I'd do it again.

1320
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,007
H: Why don't you have pudding
after breakfast?

1321
01:19:08,682 --> 01:19:12,246
You have it after lunch and dinner,
so why not in the morning as well?

1322
01:19:12,357 --> 01:19:13,655
I think it weird.

1323
01:19:16,799 --> 01:19:18,290
You're still sad, aren't you?

1324
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:22,234
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1325
01:19:23,144 --> 01:19:26,378
I knew you would be. I bought you sweets.

1326
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:31,192
Thank you. Great.

1327
01:19:32,261 --> 01:19:35,198
I didn't know which is your favorite,
so I bought pick-and-mix.

1328
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:39,698
(Sobbing)

1329
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:44,250
Oh, sorry, H, sorry.

1330
01:19:46,556 --> 01:19:47,989
It's just...

1331
01:19:48,727 --> 01:19:50,753
I'm trying to do the right thing...

1332
01:19:53,169 --> 01:19:55,001
and now I think I should have not...

1333
01:19:57,177 --> 01:19:58,440
'cause...

1334
01:19:58,645 --> 01:20:02,050
if she'd stayed with me out of guilt,
that would have been fine, wouldn't it?

1335
01:20:03,522 --> 01:20:05,287
I mean, wouldn't it?

1336
01:20:05,659 --> 01:20:08,028
My maths teacher, Mrs. O'Casey...

1337
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,297
has something she always says
when people are sad.

1338
01:20:11,403 --> 01:20:15,572
She says, "No problem is insoluble,
given a big enough plastic bag."

1339
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:17,147
(Laughing)

1340
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:23,314
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. She's very unusual.

1341
01:20:25,631 --> 01:20:27,191
I should have married you.

1342
01:20:27,302 --> 01:20:28,496
Maybe in 10 years.

1343
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:31,234
If you're still lonely,
we could get married then.

1344
01:20:32,979 --> 01:20:34,778
You know, it's funny.

1345
01:20:35,851 --> 01:20:39,517
Ever since we first met,
I was scared that she was gonna leave me.

1346
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,997
You shouldn't be afraid, Heck.
You can do anything.

1347
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,041
(Sighing)

1348
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:55,415
RACHEL: Hurry. Hurry, please.
Take a left here.

1349
01:20:56,124 --> 01:20:59,358
TESSA: I just think, if not Heck,
there must be other fish in the sea.

1350
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:00,488
Male fish.

1351
01:21:00,598 --> 01:21:02,568
- Is it straight on?
- Yes.

1352
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:03,963
Rather exciting.

1353
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:06,635
And what about my grandchildren?
Who'll be providing them?

1354
01:21:06,745 --> 01:21:08,840
I believe
there's a marvelous new invention...

1355
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:11,282
- somewhat akin to the turkey baster.
- Just up here.

1356
01:21:14,993 --> 01:21:17,396
- And where did you two meet?
- At my wedding.

1357
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:20,265
But it's such a short time.
How can you be sure?

1358
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:22,272
I knew after three seconds.

1359
01:21:22,574 --> 01:21:26,537
I've heard of love happening that fast.
The French call it le flash.

1360
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:28,379
They would, bloody perverts.

1361
01:21:30,924 --> 01:21:32,917
Where's Luce? Is she here?

1362
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:35,059
Would you like to try that entrance again?

1363
01:21:36,868 --> 01:21:39,635
Hello. Please, I'm looking for Luce.

1364
01:21:41,778 --> 01:21:43,269
You're her, aren't you?

1365
01:21:44,283 --> 01:21:45,410
You're the girl.

1366
01:21:47,622 --> 01:21:48,612
Yes, I am.

1367
01:21:49,327 --> 01:21:50,420
You have a husband.

1368
01:21:52,432 --> 01:21:53,422
I left him.

1369
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:55,861
He left me.

1370
01:21:57,309 --> 01:21:58,675
It doesn't matter. It's over.

1371
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:03,111
So you're free?

1372
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:07,387
And you love my daughter?

1373
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:10,794
Golly.

1374
01:22:11,436 --> 01:22:12,665
(Chuckling)

1375
01:22:15,243 --> 01:22:17,646
Have you ever sold flowers before?

1376
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:25,485
MAN: Watch it!

1377
01:22:27,166 --> 01:22:29,330
DRIVER: And what would you be wearing?

1378
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,871
Oh, yeah, I like that.

1379
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:34,310
Oh, yeah, I like that very much.

1380
01:22:34,815 --> 01:22:36,545
LUCE: Excuse me.
DRIVER: Yeah?

1381
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:38,814
- Excuse me.
- Do you mind? I'm talking here.

1382
01:22:38,923 --> 01:22:40,789
Are you sure this is the best way?
'Cause the traffic's...

1383
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:45,230
I'll meet you at home, angel.
And will you be waiting downstairs...

1384
01:22:45,802 --> 01:22:47,361
or upstairs?

1385
01:22:53,083 --> 01:22:56,817
You're quite wrong, you know.
You've always been enough for me.

1386
01:22:57,091 --> 01:22:58,080
Not recently.

1387
01:23:02,267 --> 01:23:03,566
There are pills one can take.

1388
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,276
I could buy some...

1389
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:12,747
if you could perhaps...

1390
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:15,682
be a little kinder.

1391
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:18,698
Yes, I could.

1392
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:26,109
Darling, try a left up here.
It's generally quicker.

1393
01:23:26,814 --> 01:23:28,113
Well done.

1394
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:37,995
(Car horns honking)

1395
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:39,433
(People yelling)

1396
01:23:39,539 --> 01:23:40,734
Hang on.

1397
01:23:41,176 --> 01:23:42,201
(Honking)

1398
01:23:42,312 --> 01:23:43,302
(Sighing)

1399
01:23:43,414 --> 01:23:47,377
Three cheers for my husband.
As much use as a fart in a jam jar.

1400
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,958
Well, that was
the shortest honeymoon in history.

1401
01:23:51,063 --> 01:23:52,530
(Car horns honking)

1402
01:23:59,244 --> 01:24:00,770
(Cyclist singing)

1403
01:24:03,185 --> 01:24:04,620
(Cell phone ringing)

1404
01:24:05,623 --> 01:24:07,524
- Hello?
- Luce, it's me. Listen.

1405
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:10,929
- We have to talk. Everything's changed.
- There's nothing to say.

1406
01:24:11,034 --> 01:24:13,402
You can't do it. Bye.

1407
01:24:16,244 --> 01:24:18,076
How did that go, then?

1408
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:20,683
She'll be back.
She'll be back soon, and then you can...

1409
01:24:20,786 --> 01:24:22,379
- It's over.
- Good.

1410
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,062
Well, you know what I mean.

1411
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:28,530
(Continues singing)

1412
01:24:33,511 --> 01:24:34,501
That singing.

1413
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,787
I heard that singing before.

1414
01:24:43,063 --> 01:24:44,698
TESSA: What're you talking about?

1415
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:45,063
TESSA: What're you talking about?

1416
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:46,793
Where?

1417
01:24:46,969 --> 01:24:48,131
(Giggling excitedly)

1418
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:50,601
Mind the car.

1419
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,147
Yes, but... Oh, forget the car.

1420
01:25:03,235 --> 01:25:04,328
Luce!

1421
01:25:05,539 --> 01:25:06,564
Luce!

1422
01:25:06,675 --> 01:25:08,042
Oh, my God.

1423
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:09,672
Luce!

1424
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,449
Luce, where are you?

1425
01:25:12,887 --> 01:25:15,084
This couldn't possibly get
more embarrassing.

1426
01:25:15,191 --> 01:25:16,250
Luce!

1427
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,893
Luce, please!

1428
01:25:20,301 --> 01:25:21,360
Luce!

1429
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:39,500
(Echoing loudly) You're a wanker,
Number 9!

1430
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,103
Luce, I can do this!

1431
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,904
I can do this!

1432
01:26:13,004 --> 01:26:14,437
Let's go and talk to her. Let's go.

1433
01:26:17,078 --> 01:26:18,980
(Happy Together by The Turtles)

1434
01:26:30,336 --> 01:26:31,565
(Honking)

1435
01:27:35,397 --> 01:27:36,591
- Hey.
- Hi.

1436
01:27:41,642 --> 01:27:42,939
(Humming)

1437
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:49,988
(Singing)

1438
01:27:54,299 --> 01:27:56,668
Hey. Come here. Hi.

1439
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,173
Hi. What're you doing?

1440
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:01,473
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

1441
01:28:01,847 --> 01:28:03,009
Thanks.

1442
01:28:07,358 --> 01:28:08,826
(Both humming)

1443
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:19,910
Just making some notes
for this book that I'm writing.

1444
01:28:20,015 --> 01:28:22,144
- Oh, you're writing a book?
- Yeah.

1445
01:28:22,254 --> 01:28:23,347
Great.

1446
01:28:24,391 --> 01:28:26,087
Because I can read.

1447
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:34,431
Hi.

1448
01:28:39,821 --> 01:28:41,119
It's cold.

1449
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:42,589
It's good.

1450
01:28:42,826 --> 01:28:44,159
It's nice.

1451
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,197
It's cold.

1452
01:28:50,608 --> 01:28:52,202
How long's the flight anyway,
do you know?

1453
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:53,803
About 24 hours.

1454
01:28:55,017 --> 01:28:56,543
Plenty of time.

1455
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:15,216
THE END
