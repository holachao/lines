1
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,083
They don't understand my accent.

2
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,000
Did you try?

3
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,791
I'll call tomorrow.

4
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,208
This isn't even American.
How are you going to learn English?

5
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,250
"Longing...

6
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,250
longing for a wave of love
to swell up in me."

7
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,500
Like a lady.

8
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
Ba, did we wake you?

9
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,875
School project.

10
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,750
Â Paul made a braised pork sausage.
Pretty tasty.

11
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:20,541
Yours is in the microwave.

12
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:56,250
When Ellie's Ma died...

13
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:58,625
I fell into a dark hole.

14
01:24:59,625 --> 01:25:01,166
I didn't move for days.

15
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,083
A few days later...

16
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:09,500
I woke to find Ellie in the booth...

17
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,958
manning the switch.

18
01:25:15,041 --> 01:25:16,250
She looked up at me.

19
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:22,333
Just 13... an adult already.

20
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:26,333
And I...

21
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:29,208
smiled.

22
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:39,750
This is a lot of dumplings.

23
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:44,375
Six days, 18 meals.

24
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,291
To Grinnell.

25
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,916
We didn't come here
so you could be like me.

26
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:57,875
We came here
so you could be like your mother.

27
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,041
God, I hope not.
