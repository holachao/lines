00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,831
Good day, Esa.

00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:24,197

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,788
Now we re? E? ?
I said after? Why!

6
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,789
Strawberries are inside.

7
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:50,557
One you missed.

8
00:03:53,727 --> 00:03:55,469
This child?

9
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:14,622
Euler's formula says,
that? s cut of? e? surface? ino sphere

10
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,707
on the side edges and peaks,

11
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:22,505
and if the F Number of pages
E Number of edges and V Number of peaks

12
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,764
Always give?

13
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,478

V? E + F = 2nd

15
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,983
It's no.

16
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:39,855
The same applies to the pyramid with five
surfaces, four triangles and square.

17
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,233
Minus eight edges, five peaks.

18
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:46,153
And, for each different combination of
the edges of the sides and the peaks.

19
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:50,867
Euler was quite thorough.
? Thank you, Mr. Kipper.

20
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,790
