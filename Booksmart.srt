00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,047
<i>Good morning, winner.</i>

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,963
<i>Take a deep breath.</i>

3
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:18,422
<i>Good.</i>

4
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:20,922
<i>You're ready to dominate this day.</i>

5
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,588
<i>You've worked harder than everyone,</i>

6
00:00:24,672 --> 00:00:27,880
<i>and that is why you're a champion.</i>

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,797
<i>You understand that greatness
takes sacrifice.</i>

8
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:35,463
<i>Visualize what you still want to achieve.</i>

9
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,755
<i>Stand atop the mountain of your success</i>

10
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,463
<i>and look down at everyone</i>

11
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,547
<i>who's ever doubted you.</i>

12
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,088
<i>Fuck those losers.</i>

13
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:50,630
<i>Fuck them in their stupid fucking faces.</i>

14
00:00:58,297 --> 00:01:00,005
Hey!

15
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:01,588

00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:02,625

00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,130
- Are we gonna go to school, or--
- No.

31
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:33,295
I don't think we are.

32
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:35,880

- Whoo!
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:03,808
- Are you kidding me? Samantha!
- You couldn't have just gone around?

44
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:06,838
Where was this energy
at my inauguration assembly, folks?

45
00:02:06,922 --> 00:02:07,755
True.

46
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:11,463
I hope I never have
to see any of you ever again, okay?

47
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:12,797
That's it. Signin' off.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,380
Go, Crocketts!

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,255
Boom.

50
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:19,422
- Principal Brown?
- Oh...

51
00:02:20,088 --> 00:02:22,255
Hi, Molly, Amy. What's shakin'?

52
00:02:22,338 --> 00:02:24,755
I want to make the transition
of next year's student government

53
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:25,838
as seamless as possible,

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,297
- so that when I'm up in New Haven--
- Yale. You can just say Yale, please.

55
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,088
Well, our class's official policy
is to not discuss

56
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,671
where anyone is attending next year.

57
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,588
We don't want them to feel insecure.

58
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,605
Very thoughtful.

59
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,047
I need to go over the end of the year
budget numbers we have.

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,255
Gosh.

61
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:42,755
Really?

62
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,005
Like, now?

63
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,047
I mean, why don't you do it with Nick?
You know, please?

64
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,047
I mean, he's... you know,
he's the vice president.

65
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,005
Nick?

66
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,422
Oh!

67
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,338
We both know that Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances.

68
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,588
That position is...

69
00:02:57,338 --> 00:02:59,422
It's basically a popularity contest.
He's useless.

70
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:01,797
Ladies, it's the last day, you know?

71
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:03,463
We did it, huh?

72
00:03:03,505 --> 00:03:05,005
We got you through high school.

73
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,088
Can't we just graduate,
head off to college,

74
00:03:07,172 --> 00:03:09,755
you know,
celebrate this wonderful achievement?

75
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,271
Let's get through the day
without anything horrible happening.

76
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:14,922
Sorry, are you shutting the door on us?
Not subtle. We will persist!

77
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,255
Nick's like the great equalizer.

78
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:23,422
Delegates from every group of girls
are casting their ballots for his penis.

79
00:03:23,755 --> 00:03:25,422
Oh, Triple A takes the lead.

80
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,422
Don't call her that.

81
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:28,880
Everybody calls her that.

82
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,297
She gave roadside assistance
to three senior guys last year.

83
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,547
You hear them
getting degrading nicknames?

84
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,255
They call Sam Ross "Dick Splinter."

85
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:38,213
That's not derogatory,
it's a factual description.

86
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,755
- 7:20.
- Under eight minutes?

87
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,297
- You're joking!
- Aah!

88
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,213
Oh, my God. 9:43.

89
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,213
What am I gonna do
without you girls next year?

90
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,088
Nobody around here
even attempts the Thursday.

91
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:50,922
Well, Amy and I are gonna Skype
the puzzle every single week,

92
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,672
- so we will send you our Sunday <i>Times.</i>
- Yep.

93
00:03:52,755 --> 00:03:54,880
You know what?
Why don't I just give you two my number?

94
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:58,005
That way, you guys can call or text me
if you need anything.

95
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,672
- Yeah! That would make our lives.
- Yeah. Cool.

96
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,963
- We'd love that.
- Definitely.

97
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:04,213
- I'll give you mine after.
- I'll share the contact.

98
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:05,422
- I can give--
- I'll share it.

99
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:08,380
Wait. Miss Fine, I thought there were
no cell phones allowed in class.

100
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:10,963
- Or are there exceptions for ass-kissers?
- Hey.

101
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:12,547
A dollar in the swear jar.

102
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm so sorry.
These shorts, they don't have pockets.

103
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,297
- Okay, excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus Christ!
- Whoa, Triple A!

104
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,338
Oh, my God.

105
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:21,922
- No spatial awareness at this school.
- People just really don't.

106
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,255
- Hey, Amy?
- It's her!

107
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:24,588
Yeah?

108
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,672
Did you just score
your teacher's phone number?

109
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,088
Yeah.

110
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,338
Nice.

111
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:33,880
Hey, Miss Fine?

112
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:35,588
You should come party with us tonight.

113
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,880
Did you just ask Miss Fine
if she wants to party with you?

114
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,255
You think she wants to watch you
get drunk and break things?

115
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:44,380
Hold on. I was having a conversation
with her. You're not part of this.

116
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,422
- I'm--
- Sit down, Theo.

117
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:47,755
Yo, yo. What up, Miss Fine?

118
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,172
Just a last day present
for my favorite teach.

119
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:53,047
- Jared, you are not my student.
- I've heard great things.

120
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,380
And, hey, everybody else
got their graduation gifts, right?

121
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:57,630
Come on.

122
00:04:57,713 --> 00:04:59,838
Jare Bear coming at you
from all angles, right?

123
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,088
- Nobody asked for that.
- Uhh...

124
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:04,213
Big me, littler me,
little baby Jared at the bottom.

125
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,463
Baby Jared says,
"Happy graduation, everybody!"

126
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,713
Yeah, no one's gonna wear a shirt
with your face on it, Jared.

127
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,463
Like, not even ironically.

128
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:13,838
Okay, well, agree to disagree, 'cause--

129
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,213
Jared, just go.

130
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,547
I'm out of here. Wasn't even here.
See you, Molly.

131
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:19,713
- Bye, Molly.
- I'll see ya.

132
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:20,880
Bye, Molly.

133
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:23,588
- Why does he always do that?
- Fair townspeople!

134
00:05:23,672 --> 00:05:25,172
Fair townspeople?

135
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:27,255
Fair townspeople, I swear to God!

136
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:30,088
- What?
- Mark thy calendars

137
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:34,172
and make thy plans to attend
the drama department's summer program,

138
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,922
Shakespeare in the Park... ing Lot.

139
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:42,088
We will be performing the Bard's comedies
as modern tragedies

140
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:44,213
outside Whole Foods across town.

141
00:05:44,297 --> 00:05:45,630
Well, it's actually funny. It's...

142
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,505
It's what we did in my summer program

143
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,588
- last year in...
- Barcelona,

144
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,463
when I lived in Barcelona.

145
00:05:51,547 --> 00:05:53,047
I will be directing,

146
00:05:53,505 --> 00:05:54,963
and Alan...

147
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,047
may be starring, pending auditions.

148
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,213
I don't audition.

149
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:02,297
I'm offer only.

150
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,922
This looks fun, but I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna be here.

151
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:08,005
Yeah, Amy's spending the summer
in Botswana,

152
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,630
helping women make their own tampons.

153
00:06:09,713 --> 00:06:10,547
That's...

154
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:11,838
gross.

155
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:14,630
Well, blood attracts lions.
I'm saving lives.

156
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:18,422
Oh, okay. Well, that's actually noble.
I, too, have a fear of big cats.

157
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:22,255
And I can't because I'm working
all summer, and also, I don't want to.

158
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,255
You are a philistine.

159
00:06:23,338 --> 00:06:25,380
Why would you do theater
when you could do debate?

160
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,922
Because some of us
enjoy working with others.

161
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,547
And some of us know how to win.

162
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,338
Nobody's winning in that outfit.

163
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,213
Sit down, y'all.
We got work to do.

164
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,088
- So, Molly...
- Mmm?

165
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,797
- Why don't you start us off?
- Thank you.

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,755
Kill it.

167
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:40,463
All right, well, as you might recall
from my analysis yesterday,

168
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,255
- we were talking about...
- It's our last day!

169
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,213
- Let us live! God!
- ...submitting to authority...

170
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:45,422
You've gotta open...

171
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,380
You've gotta open your mouth
a little bit more, all right?

172
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:50,297
- Yeah, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
- Okay, chips!

173
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,213
- All right, this is it.
- I gotcha. Ready?

174
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:54,505
- Dude, how am I supposed to get there?
- That was my bad.

175
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:55,630
- Nick?
- You're wild.

176
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,505
- Nick.
- Wait, just one sec. Just... come on.

177
00:06:57,588 --> 00:06:59,672
Nick, there's some student government
stuff to go over.

178
00:06:59,755 --> 00:07:00,963
Come on, man, aim for my mouth!

179
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,380
We have to go over the end of year budget,
so if you could...

180
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:06,255
Yeah, just, we're playin' this game
where I've gotta catch it with--

181
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:08,422
It's complicated.
I'll... I'll hit you later, I guess.

182
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:09,880
I'm sure it's complicated.

183
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:10,797
Oh!

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,922
I cannot believe I lasted an entire year
with Nick as my vice president.

185
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:17,797
He's allergic to work.
All he wants to do is goof off.

186
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It's infuriating.

What? No.

191
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,463
Cool, cool, 'cause I'm...
I'm gonna go talk to Ryan.

192
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:40,588
- 'Cause I have so much to say--
- No, no, no.

193
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,838
- Yeah?
- Fine.

194
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:47,672
Just... I'm going.

00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:49,422

Amy.

201
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:06,463
- It's all good.
- Here you go.

202
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:07,713
Sharp elbows.

203
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,713
Not as sharp as your... chin.

204
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:11,130
What?

205
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,880
Um... so isn't it crazy
that it's-- it's the last day?

206
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:15,963
I know, dude. I can barely believe it.

207
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,672
Are you gonna come to Nick's tonight?

208
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,755
His aunt went on a cruise ship
that broke down,

209
00:08:19,838 --> 00:08:21,588
so Nick's gonna throw a party
at her house.

210
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:23,088
That's... that's awesome.

211
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:24,713
It's... it's all right.

212
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:27,463
They're, you know, they're stuck
on a boat shitting in buckets.

213
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,005
Oh, that's not really what I meant.

214
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:30,922
Oh, Jesus.

215
00:08:31,005 --> 00:08:32,755
- Come on, Tanner.
- All right, well...

216
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,005
All right, I'll see you later.

217
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,422
I'll just, um...

218
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,255
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

219
00:08:38,338 --> 00:08:40,005
- What are you doing? Go back.
- Fuck, fuck.

220
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,672
No, that was bad. That was bad. I'm good.

221
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,338
I don't even know if she's into girls.

222
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,838
She wore a polo shirt to prom.

223
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:47,297
Well, that's just her gender performance.

224
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,047
It's different from
her sexual orientation.

225
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,505
I'm sorry, but I don't get it.

226
00:08:50,588 --> 00:08:54,297
- Well, gender is a construct of--
- No. Thank you. That much I understand.

227
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,588
It's just... it's a little bit shocking

228
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:58,338
that... that you're into Ryan.

229
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:01,422
First crush, the little white cat
from <i>The Aristocats.</i>

230
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,130
You go from that to Avril Lavigne.

231
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:05,297
It just... it's not...
it's not what I anticipated.

232
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,880
I just like that she's...

233
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,588
always in a good mood,
and she's got a really cute smile.

234
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,797
She just seems like
she'd be a really fun person

235
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,797
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

236
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,297
Excuse me, pardon me? I'm a fun person
to have sleepovers and lie around with.

237
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,463
It's literally all we do.

238
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,672
Well, with her, there'd be more...

239
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,338
vagina involved.

240
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:26,672
That's fair.

241
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,713
She said Nick's having a party tonight.

242
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:31,838
Of course he would.
He's so fucking stupid.

243
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:34,797
Somebody always gets arrested
the night before graduation.

244
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:39,588
Amy, do you know how many girls
are gonna be up your vagina

245
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:40,922
at Columbia next year?

246
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:43,047
Are you aware of it?
'Cause I'm aware of it.

247
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,630
Every time I come to visit you, you're
just gonna be scissoring a different girl.

248
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,797
Dude?

249
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,172
Scissoring is not a thing.

250
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,880
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.
- It's not a thing.

251
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:54,963
- I'm not knocking it. It's not a thing.
- Don't knock it until you've tried it.

That car belongs in a museum.

261
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,630
What the fuck, Jared?
I said door-to-door.

262
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:19,922
Museum of death,
'cause its smog is killing us all.

263
00:10:21,047 --> 00:10:23,130
- Fuck!
- You all right?

264
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:25,838
They spend every minute together.
It's so weird.

265
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:27,505
We spend every minute together.

266
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,505
We are equals.

267
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,963
Gigi just keeps Jared around
for when she needs a liver.

268
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,297
- No, please don't get on my car.
- I'm fucking spent, Jared!

269
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,255
- At least take the heels off.
- I'm fucking spent!

270
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,672
- I just got it back from the shop.
- Okay, shh! I'm napping.

271
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:41,547
Do you think it's true that his dad got
him a sex worker for his 14th birthday?

272
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,047
It's too weird of a story to be made up.

273
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:45,797
There's so many specifics.

274
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,213
He sprained his ankle,
she had a hearing aid.

275
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,422
What up, <i>chicas?</i>

276
00:10:49,505 --> 00:10:50,755
It's intolerable.

277
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:51,922
You guys... you guys hungry?

278
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,297
I got... I got some soup dumps.

279
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,088
Keep it down out there!

280
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,130
They're probably soggy now,
but they're great cold!

281
00:10:58,213 --> 00:10:59,172
- Good Lord.
- S'all right.

282
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,380
I'm going to pee in your weird bathroom.
Watch my stuff.

283
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,380
Until all of us can pee without genitals,
none of us can.

284
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,005
These motherfuckers.

285
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:08,713
"Your ugly" what?

286
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,213
How did you graduate sixth grade?

287
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:12,922
It's shocking to me.

288
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,172
So, okay, so, I win.

289
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:17,380
- Marry the sex doll, okay?
- Right.

290
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:19,130
- Fuck the soccer ball.
- Yep.

291
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:20,547
And then, kill Molly.

292
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,297
Dude, no!

293
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,505
There's no other way, dude.

294
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:25,380
Like, I can't fuck her,
you know, 'cause...

295
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:27,505
when I'm scared, my dick can't get hard.

296
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:29,755
And then, like, I can't marry her,
'cause, well,

297
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:31,963
- I don't believe in the institution.
- Uh-huh.

298
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:33,713
So I have to kill Molly.

299
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,922
And I know it'll haunt me.
I'm a peaceful person.

300
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,963
That's very true.

301
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,047
Wait, are you guys talking
about Molly Davidson?

302
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:40,963
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

303
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:43,963
That girl is so weird.
She always acts like she's, like, 40.

304
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:47,088
I wish she was fuckin' 40, man.
Women in their forties know themselves.

305
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:50,047
Oh, she's cute,
you know, yeah, I give her that,

306
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,463
but she'd probably make you quiz her
on her SAT analogies while you fuck her.

307
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,005
Dude, no, her vagina is probably stuffed
with diplomas, how much do you wanna bet?

308
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:59,047
That shit's like a filing cabinet
down there.

309
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,838
Well, I've got no problem
with a filing cabinet.

310
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,880
I would make passionate sex
to Molly Davidson.

311
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:06,005
Really?

312
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:08,422
Yeah, I'd just put a bag
over her personality.

313
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:10,172
- Yeah.
- That's it.

314
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,463
Molly's like a butterface for personality,
a butter personality.

315
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,255
Yeah!

316
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,963
- It's so bad.
- Yeah.

317
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,672
That's cool, man. What?

318
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:22,963
Shit.

319
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:27,380
Oh.

320
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,130
Oh, please, do not stop on my account.

321
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:34,463
Do you know what?
My vag is stuffed with diplomas.

322
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,505
Soon it's gonna be stuffed
with job offers,

323
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,255
and glowing profiles,
and commendations from the governor.

324
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:45,255
So, while you guys
were all studying AP hand jobs,

325
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,505
I was kicking ass and busting curves.

326
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:50,213
And I'm gonna continue to do that
at Yale next year.

327
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:51,172
So...

328
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,047
I like my choices,

329
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,755
and wherever you three are next year,
I hope you do, too.

330
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,088
I'm going to Yale, too.

331
00:13:01,172 --> 00:13:02,130
What?

332
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:06,380
I'm incredible at hand jobs,
but I also got a 1560 on the SATs.

333
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:08,672
No, you didn't.

334
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,005
I got in early.

335
00:13:10,088 --> 00:13:11,463
- To Yale?
- Uh-huh.

336
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:12,713
- Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.

337
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,630
Mm-hm.

338
00:13:13,713 --> 00:13:16,088
Oh, um, Tanner,
where are you going to school?

339
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,005
Uh, I'm... I'm playing soccer at Stanford.

340
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:22,213
Stanford University?
What are you guys talking about? That's--

341
00:13:22,297 --> 00:13:25,005
- No, yes, Stanford.
- Mm-hm. Stanford University.

342
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,130
Hey, I'm not going to college.

343
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:29,297
I got recruited to go code for Google.

344
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,130
I mean, it's not Apple,

345
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:33,463
but the bennies are pretty tight, man,

346
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,588
and it's mid six-figures,
so I'm not complainin'.

347
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,338
- That's my boy.
- So proud of you. Amazing.

348
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:39,713
You failed the seventh grade twice.

349
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:41,005
Rule of threes.

350
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,255
- You guys are serious?
- Mm-hm.

351
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:49,547
Hey, um, I'm gonna pretend
like I don't know you next year.

352
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:50,838
No offense.

353
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,713
Hmm.

354
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:54,880
This... this isn't possible.

355
00:13:54,963 --> 00:13:56,713
You guys don't even care about school.

356
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:58,797
No.

357
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,338
We just don't only care about school.

358
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:11,255
Well, I'm... I'm done.

359
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:13,255
After-- After you. After you, man.

360
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:14,213
Okay.

361
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:17,297
Sorry, excuse me.

362
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:24,255
<i>You've worked harder</i>
<i>than everyone who's ever doubted you.</i>

363
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:27,422
<i>You've worked harder.</i>

364
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:28,547
<i>...doubted you.</i>

365
00:14:37,672 --> 00:14:38,505
Hey.

366
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,380
You okay?

367
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,547
Nick, where are you going
to school next year?

368
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,047
- I thought we weren't supposed to talk--
- Just tell me!

369
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,797
Georgetown. Jesus.

370
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:51,172
- Hope, where are you going next year?
- No, I couldn't be less interested

371
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:53,380
in, like, whatever this is.

372
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,797
Gigi, where the fuck
are you going to school next year?

373
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,838
Don't judge me, it was my fifth choice.

374
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,088
Harvard.

375
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,547

391

Okay.

392
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,255
This is obviously not helping.

393
00:16:20,338 --> 00:16:24,213
We chose. We didn't party
because we wanted to focus on school

394
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:25,797
and get into good colleges.

395
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,838
And it worked.

396
00:16:26,922 --> 00:16:29,088
But the irresponsible people who partied

397
00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:31,422
also got into those colleges,
they did both.

398
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,338
So?

399
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:33,713
So we messed up.

400
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:35,922
We didn't have to choose. They did both.

401
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,880
We are the only assholes who did one.

402
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,880
Hey, we are not assholes, okay?

403
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:41,838
Let's just...

404
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:44,047
Come sit down, we'll cut the cake,

405
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,297
look at the memory box,

406
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,672
- celebrate the end--
- This is not a time to celebrate.

407
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,838
We have to go to a party tonight.

408
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:53,380
- What?
- Let's go to Nick's party.

409
00:16:53,463 --> 00:16:55,172
No-- Are you kidding? No. No way.

410
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,797
Amy, we only have one night left

411
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,713
to have studied and partied
in high school.

412
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:02,588
Otherwise, we're just gonna be the girls
that missed out.

413
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:03,713
We haven't done anything.

414
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:05,380
We haven't broken any rules.

415
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:08,255
Okay, we've broken a lot of rules.

416
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,922
One, we have fake IDs.

417
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:12,963
Fake college IDs,
so we can get into their 24-hour library.

418
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,880
Name one person whose life
was so much better

419
00:17:15,963 --> 00:17:17,880
- because they broke a couple of rules.
- Picasso.

420
00:17:17,963 --> 00:17:20,422
Yes, he broke art rules.
Name a person who broke a real one.

421
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:21,713
- Rosa Parks.
- Name another.

422
00:17:21,797 --> 00:17:23,547
- Susan B. Anthony.
- Goddamn it.

423
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,630
Amy, I'm so serious.
They think that we're robots.

424
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,047
They think all we care about is taking
a million APs, and getting into Yale,

425
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,963
and editing <i>Law Review</i> at Georgetown,

426
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,505
and clerking for a federal judge
between junior and senior year

427
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,505
before eventually becoming
the youngest justice

428
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:41,463
ever nominated
to the Supreme Court of the United States.

429
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,338
In my case.

430
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:47,297
You get the point.

431
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:50,547
- Nobody knows that we are fun.
- We know.

432
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,505
They need to know.

433
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:52,422
Who's they?

434
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,422
We are not one-dimensional.

435
00:17:54,505 --> 00:17:56,505
We are smart and fun.

436
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:58,880
We have to do this.

437
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,005
This is crazy.

438
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:02,380
We graduate tomorrow.

439
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:03,922
What if we get in trouble?

440
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,005
You know that we are too smart for that.

441
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,963
Plus, Ryan is gonna be there.

442
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:11,505
She wanted you to come.
You're finally gonna make your moves.

443
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,255
No, she's not...

444
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:15,672
You've been out for two years
and you've never kissed a girl.

445
00:18:15,755 --> 00:18:17,547
I want you to experience this.

446
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,547
What will I be doing during that time,
you might ask?

447
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,755
I'm going to experience
a seminal fun anecdote,

448
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,922
and we are gonna change
our stories forever.

449
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:32,088
We were gonna watch that Ken Burns thing.

450
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,880
<i>The Dust Bowl </i>can wait, bitch!

451
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,880

00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,255

- No. Not acceptable.
- Not okay.

459
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,880
Who allowed you to be this beautiful?

460
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:58,172
- Who allowed you to be this beautiful?
- Who allowed you to take my breath away?

461
00:18:58,255 --> 00:19:00,172
- Call the paramedics, call the police.

- I can't look right at it.

463
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,088
Not today!

464

Oh. Work.

Get it? Tushy?

467
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,672
Hand sanitizer.

468
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:14,755
ChapStick.

469
00:19:14,838 --> 00:19:15,963
College IDs.

470
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:19,172
Now, mace. Listen, it is very important
that you keep the safety--

471
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,422
Oh!

472
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:22,047
- Ah! Amy!
- The safety's not on!

473
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,588
Don't touch your eyes!

474
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,630
You have the same parts she does.

475
00:19:25,713 --> 00:19:28,463
You just take what you do to yourself,
flip it upside down.

476
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:30,338
Well, I don't... I don't really--

477
00:19:30,422 --> 00:19:32,630
Just a down, but a flip.

478
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,130
- I don't--
- A down flip.

479
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,547
Well... what if I don't use my hands?

480
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,255
You can make yourself come
using only your mind?

481
00:19:39,338 --> 00:19:41,255
- No.
- That's the one thing my mind can't do.

482
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:44,797
No! Well, I use just... other stuff.

483
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:47,172
- A book?
- No.

484
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,338
Very Freudian,
but I'd worry about paper cuts.

485
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,505
No. Can we just stop talking about this?

486
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:54,047
- That little elephant?
- No! Stop!

487
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,672
That weird crochet pig?

488
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:57,255
My grandma gave me that
before she died!

489
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,005
If you don't tell me what it is,
you know--

490
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,005
It's the panda! It's the panda, okay?

491
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:03,255
The panda. Whatever. Just...

492
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,838
Can we just stop talking about this?

493
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:08,338
Please, for the love of all things.

494
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:09,672
Quick question.

495
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,672
Just a quick Q.

496
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,213
What happened to her eye?

497
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,255
That fell off way before
anything happened between us.

498
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:19,505
- Does she talk dirty to you?
- Mm-mm.

499
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,672
- Tell you about how she's endangered?
- No!

500
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,380
- Stop!
- Do pandas roar?

501
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,213
- Stop!
- You sneaky little bitch.

502
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:30,130
I can't believe you didn't tell me

503
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:32,755
that you have been mounting
that tragic panda

504
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:34,463
every single night!

505
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:36,338
- Yeah.
- This is-- Honestly, it's exhilarating.

506
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:38,255
I thought I knew everything about you.

507
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,588
I think it's healthy for a relationship
to have secrets, and now we have one.

508
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:44,255
Do I have a secret for you? Okay, yes.

509
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,255
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

510
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,880
- I once tried to masturbate...
- Mm.

511
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,213
with an electric toothbrush.

512
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:53,172
But I got a horrible UTI.

513
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:54,672
Horrible.

514
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,630
Like...

515
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,188
horrible.

516
00:20:57,547 --> 00:21:01,963
I wish that would have been a secret,
but you've mentioned it many, many times.

517
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:05,297
Hey. Hey!

518
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,463
I need you to do the talking.

519
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:10,172
Why don't you just tell them
we're going to a party?

520
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,255
Because they'll ask too many questions.
They'll try to call Nick's aunt.

521
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,838
I've never lied to my parents before.

522
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:18,338
You know when I lie,
I just add too many details.

523
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:22,630
Just make up a story, but don't say
we're having a date night or anything.

524
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,963
Why? It's funny
your parents think we're boning.

525
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,255
No, it's not,

526
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,172
because you're not the one
who has to deal with their creepy smiles

527
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,213
when I tell them
I'm meeting you at the library,

528
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:33,630
when I'm actually
meeting you at the library.

529
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,422
Honestly, it's surprising
that Doug and Charmaine are supportive,

530
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:37,963
considering their whole Jesus thing.

531
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:38,922
It's nice.

532
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,672
- Charmaine, get to the safe room.
- Hey!

533
00:21:40,755 --> 00:21:42,297
- We're bein' robbed by supermodels.
- Hi!

534
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,713
Aw, you girls look fabulous.

535
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:46,797
- Oh...
- And smart, and also brave.

536
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,088
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks.

537
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:49,172
- Aww!
- Are you guys cold?

538
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,297
- Oh, no.
- A little nippy.

539
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,547
I'll start a fire,
or I'll turn up the heat.

540
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,755
Just get the jackets off.
Dinner's about ready.

541
00:21:54,838 --> 00:21:56,297
- Oh, you've gotta taste this.
- Well...

542
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,713
- Yeah.
- I'm calling it "diplo-meatball."

543
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,005
- Sure.
- Don't engage them.

544
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:02,672
Oh, right, right, okay. Um...

545
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,255
Char-Char, Dougsicles,

546
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:08,297
would it be okay
if Amy stayed over at my house tonight?

547
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,338
- The... the night before graduation?
- Yeah.

548
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,922
You know, my mom can drive us
to the ceremony.

549
00:22:17,005 --> 00:22:20,880
We just want as much time together
as we can before she leaves for Africa.

550
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:22,255
We made, uh...

551
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:24,380
mushroom cap and gowns.

552
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:27,255
- Yeah...
- We made special names for all this stuff.

553
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:29,838
- Great deal of care was taken.
- Well...

554
00:22:29,922 --> 00:22:31,588
Every... I mean, look, uh...

555
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:33,922
Chips and sal-so long, high school.

556
00:22:34,005 --> 00:22:35,672
You know, cheese and...

557
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,797
sala-me being your dad
was the greatest honor of my life.

558
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:41,838
You know, e-everything has a name.

559
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:44,505
- O-love my baby girl. That's olives.
- Yeah.

560
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:46,463
- Doug.
- Do you know what? We get it.

561
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:47,880
- But--
- We get it.

562
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:49,963
- Yes, yes, yes.
- We understand, okay?

563
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,880
- What you two have...
- We do. I'm sorry.

564
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:55,463
- What they have is very, very special.
- I'm sorry.

565
00:22:55,547 --> 00:22:56,713
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

566
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:58,505
Oh! It really is.

567
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,005
It is. You know, they say
you never forget your first--

568
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:02,922
Friend.

569
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,922
- Special friend.
- Normal friend.

570
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,422
- Yeah, my special friend.
- Mm. Yeah.

571
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:11,255
I'm just so thankful
we get to spend the whole night together

572
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,463
to really show each other

573
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:16,047
- how much we care about each other.
- Ah. Oh!

574
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,755
- That's great.
- Mmm, my girl.

575
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:20,172
We'll probably just do
a Korean face mask.

576
00:23:20,255 --> 00:23:22,047
Well, I don't need to know all the words.

577
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:24,547
- Okay.
- Go, go, go!

578
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:31,547
Whoo-hoo! That's it!

579
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,672

00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:50,088
- Tanner ate a ghost pepper.
<i>- Oh, my--</i>

588
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,380
He needs milk. Someone get him milk.

589
00:23:52,463 --> 00:23:55,088
- That's... that's not gonna help.
<i>- Oh, fuck!</i>

<i>- Oh, my...</i>
<i>- Oh!</i>

591
00:23:57,255 --> 00:24:00,005
Oh, that's too much milk.
He.. he just had too much milk.

592
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:03,255
Fuck! No one is answering.

593
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:06,380
Somebody give me the address!

594
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:09,130
We've never hung out
with any of these people

595
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:11,005
outside of academic activities.

596
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,755
They probably think we're calling
about school stuff.

597
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:15,172
You're right.

598
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,505
Can we just call a Lyft?

599
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:18,713
We still don't know where we're going.

600
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,422
Do you know a Lyft driver
that knows where Nick's aunt lives?

601
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:24,422
I think I do.

602
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:27,922
Who are you calling?

603
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,005
Don't worry about it, <i>chica.</i>

604
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:31,422
What?

605
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,838

609
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:48,963
- No.
- I'm so glad you called.

610
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:51,588
Sorry it took so long. Traffic was nerts.

611
00:24:52,255 --> 00:24:53,255
I'll co-- I'll come...

612
00:24:53,338 --> 00:24:55,755
It's like Guy Fieri's wet dream.

613
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:57,255
It's a means to an end.

614
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,047
May I offer you the front,
mademoiselle?

615
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,255
No? Goin' for the back? That's cool.

616
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:05,713
Back's great too. Great air flow
back there. Get on in there.

617
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,297
Okay. Time for some nights
we'll never remember

618
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,088
with friends we'll never forget, huh?

619
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:11,797
Jared, you know where the party is, right?

620
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,005
Absofruitly, ladies.

621
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:16,297
We are headed to the biggest, coolest
grad night party in town.

622
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,797
Can I get a what-what?

623

Jesus Christ.

624
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:22,505
No? That's okay. Maybe later.
It's over on the west side, so...

625
00:25:22,963 --> 00:25:24,088

Oh, my God. This is drugs.

- What?
- What?

652
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,130
Hey, Jare.
Jared, we're just gonna hop out here.

653
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,588
- Wait, what? Why?
- No.

654
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:39,630

- No, I'm not.

she hit a possum with her car.

657
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,505
- No! You know what kind of possum?
- Yeah. It's bad.

658
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:49,713
But the possum didn't die.
Its adrenaline and-- and rage

659
00:26:49,797 --> 00:26:52,672
- just made it start chasing her--
- We are not hopping off. Keep driving.

660
00:26:52,755 --> 00:26:55,755
What about the po-- Is she gonna be okay?
Wanna text her and see if she's okay?

661
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,005
Enough about the possum!
Jared, you took Spanish, right?

- But we are here.
- What do we do? What do we do?

667
00:27:24,297 --> 00:27:26,713
- Don't move, don't inhale.
- All right.

668
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,172
Oh, shit.

669
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,672

Oh, no, that's...

It's not drugs.
That's just Gigi's vitamins.

Her... her what?

674
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:41,463
Yeah, you know, like vitamin D, B-12. Gigi
likes to crush them up and snort them.

675
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:44,297
She says they work better that way.
We'll get you cleaned up on board.

Okay, now, you guys said
you wanted to go to the best party.

678
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,338
So... I brought you to the best party.

679
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,505
Which is my party!

680
00:27:55,088 --> 00:27:56,713
Prepare to get bashed!

681
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,797
Not-- Not in, like, a violent way.

682
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,463
Completely consensual bashing.
I don't know if that was clear.

683
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,047
"Prepared to get consensually bashed."

684
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,838
I'll have 'em change it.
What do you think?

685
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:07,797
You're serious, Jared? This is your party?

686
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,505
You don't wanna go
to Nick's lame house party. You don't.

687
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,213
A boat is international waters, right?

688
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:14,880
Maritime law.
Just come check it out for a little bit.

689
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:16,005
It's sick.

690
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:18,922
The catering company said it's
the coolest party they've ever been to.

691
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,422
And I'll tell you somethin'.

692
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:23,172
They worked Sasha Obama's sweet 16.

693
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,630
- Up to you.
- What are we thinking?

694
00:28:27,213 --> 00:28:29,213
- We still don't have Nick's address.
- Mm.

695
00:28:29,547 --> 00:28:31,797
Someone on board might know where it is.

696
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,130
And I'd like to meet someone
who met Sasha.

697
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,672
Yeah, respect for Sasha. Okay.

698
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:38,755
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

699
00:28:38,838 --> 00:28:39,672
Let's go.

700
00:28:40,297 --> 00:28:41,297
You guys excited?

701
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,422
Welcome to the club!

702
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:47,755
Oh, no.

703
00:28:47,838 --> 00:28:49,880
Cool, huh? We're on a boat.
What's up with that?

704
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,588
There is not a soul here, Ames.

705
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:52,547
Ice tiger.

706
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,505
This is insane. You made gift bags?

707
00:28:55,297 --> 00:28:57,047
There is an iPad in here.

708
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,713
Preloaded with photos of all of our best
high school memories, class of 2019.

709
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,172
Say what? Champagne?

710
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,505
There's a masseuse in the back,
male or female.

711
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:06,630
Gambling behind the bar. Do you guys tan?

712
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,797
I'm so happy you guys are here.

713
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,505
- I knew you guys partied. Didn't I?
- You did, she said it.

714
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,255
I told him. "Those guys seem quiet,

715
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:18,047
but they're probably spending
every weekend at, like, a sex dungeon."

716
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,755
- No.
- Here, try one of these strawberries.

717
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:21,755
Okay.

718
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,047
No.

719
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,963
- No, no, no...
- Mmm...

720
00:29:25,047 --> 00:29:27,047
Mmm...

721
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,797
- Ah.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

722
00:29:30,922 --> 00:29:32,505
- Not bad.
- That's pretty good.

723
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:33,422
Wait.

724
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:37,505

725
00:29:37,588 --> 00:29:40,838

726
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,755
Oh, God, you taste like my vitamins.

00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:44,797
- Uh...
<i>- </i>I think I'm in love with you.

728
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,922
I don't think you are.

729
00:29:46,005 --> 00:29:47,672
- You're coming with me.
- What?

730
00:29:47,755 --> 00:29:49,963
Dance party upstairs!

731
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:51,630
Yeah! Whoo!

733
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,463
Amy? Amy? Amy? Ame, we're not--

734
00:29:55,547 --> 00:29:58,005
Look what I found... with your name on it.

735
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,213
Come on, too cool.

736
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,047
How do you feel, huh? You look stoked.

737
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,755
- Chicken spring roll?
- No, thank you.

738
00:30:03,922 --> 00:30:05,005
Oh, you, uh...

739
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,713
Oh!

740
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:07,672
You want?

741
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,588
Oh, no thank you.

742
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,088
Not a drug person.

743
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,922
Not even pot?
I feel like it could help you relax.

744
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:16,463
<i>- </i>Nope. Doesn't work for me.
<i>- </i>Huh.

745
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,547
DJ Rod!

746
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,797
What the fuck?

747
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,463
Jared... stop.

748
00:30:25,047 --> 00:30:26,963
Jared, wrap--

749
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:29,588
Take the helmet off! Take the helmet off!

750
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:30,880
<i>♪ Oh ♪</i>

751
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,630
This isn't working.
You can't buy people's affection.

752
00:30:36,797 --> 00:30:38,130
Um...

753
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,547
No, I'm pretty sure you can.

754
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,713
'Cause I've seen it a lot.
My parents did it.

755
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,838
- Their parents did it.
- Just stop trying so hard, okay?

756
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,380
People sense it, it turns them off.

757
00:30:51,463 --> 00:30:52,547
But you try hard.

758
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,963
You try hard and everything.
That's what I like about you.

759
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:00,088
- I didn't mean it like--
- I'm just gonna...

760
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:01,880
- I meant more like--
- I'm gonna go.

761
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,172
- Lamb meatball?
- Motherfucker! You're everywhere!

762
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:08,088
One time I ate a legal pot brownie
when Model UN went to Amsterdam.

763
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,963
And as soon as I got high,
I just cried about the fact

764
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:13,130
that one day my mom will die, so...

765
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,172
- I had the exact same thing.
- Really?

766
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,922
I lost my virginity
in what I thought was a park, but...

767
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:21,255
it turned out to be a graveyard, and now
the ghost spirits live inside my eggs

768
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,630
waiting to be reborn.

769
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:23,797
That's not at all the same.

770
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,338
I always felt like we were similar.

771
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,588
- God, I'm gonna miss you.
- Oof.

772
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,005
Hey. You can't smoke up here.

773
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:29,380
- Oh...
- What'd you say to her?

774
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:31,547
- I said it to you, you can't smoke.
- Um...

775
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,838
You do not speak to her that way.

776
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,755
Is-- Is the her me? 'Cause I'm fine.

777
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:38,088
That is my best friend
in the fucking world!

778
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:41,130
- We're not, she's not--
- We'll fucking fight you to the death!

779
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,338
Oh!

780
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:43,755
Okay, I'm calling security.

781
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:47,130
- Amy, we need to get the fuck outta here--
- Oh, my God!

782
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,797
- Light 'em up, Luanne! It's go time!
- Um...

783
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:53,047
There's only one thing left to do. Jump.

784
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,088
- No! Off the boat?
- Wait, what? No! No!

785
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:56,130
- No, seriously--
- You--

786
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,213
- What are you guys doin' up here?
- Swan dive into the future!

787
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,547
Grip escape move!

788
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,255
No, no, no!

789
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:04,505
Gege? Gege?

790
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,963
- Ooh!
- Holy fuck!

791
00:32:06,047 --> 00:32:07,255
Gege, are you okay?

792
00:32:07,338 --> 00:32:09,630
- She's okay. Bail, bail, bail, bail!
- Just bail.

793
00:32:14,047 --> 00:32:15,047
Jesus!

794
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:17,672
Oh, my God!

795
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:19,797
I am so sweaty!

796
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,672
Oh, my God!

797
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:24,088
We need to figure something out
before we get to Nick's.

798
00:32:24,713 --> 00:32:26,672
- You still want to go to Nick's?
- You don't?

799
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,088
Well, dude, we went to a party.

800
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,838
We did it. Let's go home.

801
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,463
- Amy...
- Don't do your lecture voice.

802
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:38,338
That was not a party.

803
00:32:38,422 --> 00:32:40,255
Well, it definitely was a party.

804
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,922
That was a detour.

805
00:32:42,005 --> 00:32:44,588
We are A-plus people,

806
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:46,755
and we are going to an A-plus party.

807
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:47,838
Like this.

808
00:32:52,838 --> 00:32:54,380
Oh, my God, Alan responded.

809
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:56,713
We have the address!
Okay, I'm calling a Lyft.

810
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,463
Oh, my score is...

811
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,797
My score is very low.

812
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,005
I'm much too abrasive with the drivers.
You should call.

813
00:33:02,088 --> 00:33:03,047
I'm gonna go home.

814
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,547
But if you wanna go to Nick's,
you should really go. Seriously, go.

815
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,255
Malala.

816
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:13,630
Whoa.

817
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:16,338
- I'm calling Malala.
- Wow.

818
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:19,630
You know you only get,
like, one Malala a year?

819
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:20,922
Yeah, I'm calling it.

820
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:24,505
Full support, no questions asked,
you are coming with me.

821
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,463
Hmm.

822
00:33:28,672 --> 00:33:29,505
Malala.

823
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:31,338
All right.

824
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,505
Malala.

825
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,172
Oh!

826
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:38,547
Oh!

827
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,130
Um... okay. Jordan?

828
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:43,755
Yeah, and you're Am--

829
00:33:46,797 --> 00:33:48,422
Shit.

830
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,255
You know, I-I, um...

831
00:33:57,338 --> 00:34:00,588
this job's a good way to supplement
the, uh... the old income.

832
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,255
You know, teachers' salaries today
and all, so...

833
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:05,380
- It's terrible.
- Yeah, it's a disgrace.

834
00:34:05,463 --> 00:34:07,630
Meet new people
and see new parts of the city,

835
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:08,922
and run into old friends.

836
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:12,588
- Friends?
- Plus, I'm writin' a book now.

837
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:13,505
Oh.

838
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:15,338
- Yeah, yeah. I'm not just a principal.
- Cool.

839
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:19,672
Nothing more exciting or daunting
than the blank page, you know?

840
00:34:19,755 --> 00:34:21,880
One book I'm thinkin' about doin'
is a book of quotes.

841
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:25,588
Nothing more daunting or exciting
than the blank page.

842
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,922
But, yeah, that's one idea. I'm thinkin'
about doin' a detective novel.

843
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,963
Actually, you know what?
You two will love...

844
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:34,213
Amy, you'll love this.
It's a, uh... a female detective.

845
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,630
- Oh, really?
- A lady detective.

846
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,088
- Yeah, how about that?
- Interesting.

847
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:40,005
Yeah, she's, uh... And she's pregnant too.
Still workin'.

848
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:43,338
And, uh, you know, the baby,
whenever she's, like, close to a clue,

849
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:46,463
or, like, one of her hunches is,
like, uh, you know, close,

850
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:47,588
the baby kicks,

851
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,088
you know, and the harder it kicks,
the closer she is.

852
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,838
And, uh, that's where I'm at right now.

853
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:53,797
I-- I-- I don't know what to do
once, um...

854
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,838
you know, when she, um, gives birth.

855
00:34:55,922 --> 00:34:57,130
- But, um...
- Hmm.

856
00:34:57,213 --> 00:34:59,922
Hey, you dumb son of a bitch!

857
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,422
Choose a lane!

858
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,172
That was nuts.

859
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,130
Don't know what that was.

860
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,047
Oh, this town.

861
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,005
Ah, the angry people in this town...

862
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:12,463
Yeah.

863
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:19,297
Want some music maybe?

864
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,713
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

865
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,713
Genius.

866
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:25,422
<i>♪ We're gonna tear the roof off
The mother sucker ♪</i>

867
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:27,755
Dude, we're gonna get to Nick's so late.

868
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:29,963
It's fine.
Everybody shows up to parties late.

869
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,088
It's like, it's cooler to be late.

870
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,880
We're gonna arrive right at the crest.

871
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,880
Before you know it,
you'll be neck deep in Ryan.

872
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:38,297
Neck deep in what direction?

873
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,838
- You tell me.
- I don't know. I don't know anything.

874
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,838
This is like your nightmare about
having to land a commercial airliner,

875
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,713
but much, much worse.

876
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:50,713
I mean, is it? Is it worse?

877
00:35:50,797 --> 00:35:51,880
Well, yeah.

878
00:35:51,963 --> 00:35:53,547
I had the lives of 100 people
in my hands.

879
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,672
My crew was counting on me.
I was their Sully.

880
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,588
- I'm really stressed about it.
- I-m-- Okay, I know you are.

881
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:00,088
If only there was just...

882
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,130
a video of people hookin' up.

883
00:36:05,088 --> 00:36:06,963
Sorry, are you talking about porn?

884
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:08,130
- All I'm saying--
- No.

885
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:11,755
No one would know
if you watched one porn one time.

886
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:13,755
Think of it as a documentary.

887
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,422
Just a sexy documentary. It's a hot doc.

888
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:19,172
All of those women
are European trafficking victims.

889
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,838
Excuse me, ma'am, are you judging
other people's sexual preferences?

890
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:24,922
- 'Cause you fuck a panda every night.
- "Fuck a panda..." So fucking funny!

891
00:36:25,005 --> 00:36:28,422
Are you about to say you're gonna judge me
for dabbling in pornography?

892
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:31,547
- Thought you were a sex-positive feminist.
- Are you insane?

893
00:36:32,088 --> 00:36:34,338
Principal Brown is right there.

894
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:36,588
- I have headphones.
- He's four feet away from us.

895
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,547
I have headphones, madam.

896
00:36:39,963 --> 00:36:43,005
All right, but once we get a sense
of the mechanics,

897
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:46,588
- I am shutting it off real quick.
- Of course.

898
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:49,797
It's for educational purposes.

899
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,588
- Educational purposes.

00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,547
Principal Brown was my dad.

Got like 13.

915
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,088
Yeah, here. Here you go. Catch.

916
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:26,422
Didn't know you could do that
from that angle.

917
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,505
Oh, wait, what did I miss?

918
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,380
- Go back, actually.
- Yeah, scroll back.

919
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,588
- The part... Wait, start right there.
- Oh, there.

920
00:37:34,797 --> 00:37:37,588
If you guys want to listen to your music,
I can just plug it in up here.

921
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,672
- No! No! No!
- No! No!

922
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,213
No, fuck!

00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:43,963

926
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:58,755
Don't touch me.

927
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,797
Was that Cardi B?

928
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:09,130
- You... Oh, my God! You are the...
- I cannot believe it!

929
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,130
- You are the devil!
- I'm gonna die!

930
00:38:11,213 --> 00:38:13,338
I'm literally gonna physically die!

931
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:15,213
Oh, Jesus Christ.

932
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,672
Come in.

933
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:21,713
He's dead!

934
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:23,172
What the fuck?

935
00:38:23,255 --> 00:38:24,547
He's dead!

936
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,963
- Wh-- Who's dead?
- My husband.

937
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,338
He's been killed!

938
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:32,047
Okay, Alan, you don't have
to do your entrance

939
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,838
every time somebody arrives, okay?

940
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:38,880
- What are you guys doing here?
- What is going on?

941
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,172
It's a murder mystery party.

942
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,963
- I've been planning it for months.
- Wait, this is your house? Alan?

943
00:38:45,297 --> 00:38:49,005
Alan, I was so clear in my text
we are looking for Nick's party.

944
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,880
My husband, Robert,
was an esteemed Broadway director

945
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,755
and the love of my life.

946
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,672
And he's been killed.

947
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:57,963
Like a dog in the street.

948
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,713
- Was he stabbed?
- That sounds very tragic.

949
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,630
But there's been a mistake.
We're looking for Nick's party.

950
00:39:03,713 --> 00:39:05,838
Do you have the address? We can't find it.

951
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:07,422
I don't know a Nick.

952
00:39:08,172 --> 00:39:09,713
I only know sorrow...

953
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:11,713
and grief.

954
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:12,922
Okay, you're at a ten.

955
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,463
I need you at a two.

956
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,255
I have a wake to plan.

957
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,463
Okay, well, if you guys are here,

958
00:39:21,547 --> 00:39:23,505
you might as well take
some of the extra characters

959
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:25,922
- since two people decided not to show up.
- No--

960
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:27,088
Okay.

961
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:31,838
- Adorable farmer new to the city.
- We don't need characters.

962
00:39:31,922 --> 00:39:35,463
- We're not staying.
- Hideous barren orthodontist.

963
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:36,672
Why am I barren?

964
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,963
Am I here to farm
or have I given up that life?

965
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,422
This just says "orthodontist."

966
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:42,838
- Your backstories are in the packets.
- No, no.

967
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,297
We are not staying.
We're going to Nick's party.

968
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,672
- We can just stay for--
- No.

969
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:49,213
- The one where someone ate a ghost pepper?
- Yes.

970
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:52,380
Yeah, somebody here came from there,
I think. Maybe the mayor.

971
00:39:53,297 --> 00:39:55,588
Go! Immerse yourselves.

972
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:58,463
Review your histories in the parlor.

973
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,338
Okay, if your characters aren't married,
hands off each other.

974
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:02,422
No!

975
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:04,880
Oh.

976
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:06,672
Do not go gently.

977
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:07,672
Oh, she's really good.

978
00:40:08,463 --> 00:40:09,672
Oh, my God! You guys are here.

979
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,130
- How'd you get here?
- What the fuck?

980
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,338
How did you get here?

981
00:40:12,422 --> 00:40:13,422
And how are you dry?

982
00:40:13,797 --> 00:40:15,213
How are you dry?

983
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:16,963
Aaron, I can see you breathing.

984
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,297
Gigi? Mm. Dig deeper.

985
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,755
- I don't know what...
- I don't...

986
00:40:20,838 --> 00:40:21,672
- She was like--
- Oh!

987
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,797
- I can't think about it.

988
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,672
Oh, is it over?

989
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,463
No! Stop! Mom, do not talk to the actors!
The house is mine till 11 p.m.

990
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:31,588
Cindy, I swear to fucking God!

991
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:36,422
- Jesus Christ! God.
- Gigi! What the fuck?

992
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:38,047
Guys, the re-election is coming up

993
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,088
and I need to know
if I have to buy your votes.

994
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,422
Wait, are you the mayor?

995
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,922
Do you know where Nick's party is?

996
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:44,880
Of course I do.
I know where all the parties are.

997
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:45,797
Where is it?

998
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,838
Come into my office, now.

999
00:40:47,922 --> 00:40:49,130
Okay, thank you.

1000
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,422
In, in, in. Go, go, go.
Come, come, come. Now, now, now!

1001
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:55,380
Okay.

1002
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,422
You can't tell anyone.

1003
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:58,672
We won't.

1004
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,047
Not even each other.

1005
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,672
Okay.

1006
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:03,588
Nick's party...

1007
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:08,380
Is at...

1008
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,505
his aunt's house.

1009
00:41:11,213 --> 00:41:12,963
We know it's at his au--

1010
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:15,755
Amy, I swear to God,
I need to get out of here.

1011
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:18,047
By the way, I am pretty impressed

1012
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,338
with how well you guys
are holding it together.

1013
00:41:20,422 --> 00:41:22,047
You're doing fantastic.

1014
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,463
What do you mean?

1015
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,130
I thought the strawberries
would have hit by now.

1016
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,588
Why would strawberries hit?

1017
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:33,172
Because they were dipped
in an unbelievably potent drug.

1018
00:41:33,255 --> 00:41:36,213
It's like ayahuasca, but Asian.

1019
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:38,838
Asian-huasca.

1020
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:41,172
I told you guys that, right?

1021
00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:43,505
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I can't...

1022
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:46,297
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1023
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,838
Pull me back in.

1024
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:51,963
Pull me back in.

1025
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:58,088
Oh, my mom has a scarf that color.

1026
00:41:58,172 --> 00:41:59,047
Listen to me.

1027
00:41:59,713 --> 00:42:00,713
We're gonna be fine.

1028
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:02,172
One time I threw up,

1029
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:05,630
and my mom caught it in her hands,
'cause she loves me.

1030
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:06,880
We are healthy,

1031
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,880
nubile, young women,

1032
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:11,213
and we just need to stay calm.

1033
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,880
We are gonna be...

1034
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:34,422
What?

1035
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,422
What the fuck?

1036
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:40,005
What the fuck? What is happening?

1037
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:44,963
Why do you look like that?

1038
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:47,088
Uh, Molly, y-- you're a fucking doll.

1039
00:42:47,172 --> 00:42:49,838
- No, you're a fucking doll.
- What?

1040
00:42:50,713 --> 00:42:52,880
Ow! Fuck, that hurt.

1041
00:42:52,963 --> 00:42:55,630
And my boobs are too heavy.
I have no core.

1042
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:57,297
Our legs don't bend.

1043
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,422
They're twice as long as our torsos.

1044
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:01,630
These proportions are insane!

1045
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:02,963
Where's my chub?

1046
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,505
Wait, where are you going?

1047
00:43:05,047 --> 00:43:06,797
- This is crazy.
- Wait for me.

1048
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,297
I have to see for myself.

1049
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,463
Well, I've never done the splits
in my life.

1050
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:14,713
Amy!

1051
00:43:15,547 --> 00:43:17,297
Help! Molly, help me!

1052
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,547
Oh, my God! Don't look down, Amy, no!

1053
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,005
I-- I can't reach!

1054
00:43:21,463 --> 00:43:23,463
You have to put my heel in your hole.

1055
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,880
- My heel...? Your heel in my what?
- Your hole!

1056
00:43:25,963 --> 00:43:28,422
- What hole?
- The corn hole!

1057
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,880
Oh. Fuck!

1058
00:43:30,255 --> 00:43:31,088
Molly!

1059
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,588
Oh, my God.

1060
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,422
Um, what the fuck am I wearing?

1061
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,380
Where's my vag?

1062
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:41,880
Uh, Molly, I have no genitals.

1063
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:44,005
How do I pee? How do I shit?

1064
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,130
I mean, I don't even have nipples.
These are just mounds.

1065
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,297
My whole body's like a fucking dolphin.

1066
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,755
Just... just...

1067
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,047
Perfect, round.

1068
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,297
- Huge mounds.
- Uh, what?

1069
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,338
Look at my body. I am beautiful.

1070
00:43:57,422 --> 00:43:59,130
- No, don't get sucked in.
<i>- ♪ Ah, push it ♪</i>

1071
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:01,172
This is our nightmare, Amy.

1072
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:03,630
I know this is unrealistic
and bad for women,

1073
00:44:03,713 --> 00:44:05,463
but... is it bad?

1074
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:07,088
Because I feel pretty good.

1075
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:08,713
I mean, this ass won't quit.

1076
00:44:08,797 --> 00:44:10,755
Amy, use your brain!

1077
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:15,047
I don't need to use my brain.
I just need to be smooth and flexible.

1078
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,005
Look at you, you bad bitch.

1079
00:44:17,797 --> 00:44:20,130
Okay, that's it, we have to wake up.

1080
00:44:20,213 --> 00:44:22,422
My, my, my. Mm.

1081
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:26,963
I think I might, like,
actually stay here for a while.

1082
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:29,380
No, I won't let you do this.

1083
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,672
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop!

1084
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:34,088
You need to throw up.

1085
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,088
Let me have this body!

1086
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:40,297
Now that the amuse-bouche
of bacon-wrapped dates is over,

1087
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,630
why don't we play a rousing round
of <i>J'accuse!</i>

1088
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,005
Fuck you, George.

1089
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,130
Who is she supposed to be?

1090
00:44:57,213 --> 00:44:58,630
The orthodontist.

1091
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,838
We're okay.

1092
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:03,422
We're okay.

1093
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,130
We did it.

1094
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:08,005
We went... we went to two parties,
we did drugs.

1095
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:10,130
We can say we went out.

1096
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:12,880
- Let's go home.
- What?

1097
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,838
No, the plan is to go to Nick's.

1098
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,922
We have to stick to the plan.

1099
00:45:18,088 --> 00:45:20,630
Dude, nothing has gone
according to plan tonight.

1100
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:23,297
Which is why we have to stick to the plan.
Let's call another Lyft.

1101
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,755
Why are you being so pushy?

1102
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,630
Honestly, pushy is a compliment.
You know who else was pushy?

1103
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:29,463
Diane Sawyer, Joan of Arc,

1104
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:32,172
- Queen Noor of Jordan--
- I know where Queen Noor is from!

1105
00:45:32,255 --> 00:45:34,297
Once we get to Nick's,
all of this will be worth it.

1106
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,255
Just forget about about Nick's!
No one will even tell us where it is.

1107
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,130
Why are you being so obsessed
with his party?

1108
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:41,422
- Because she loves him.
- Oh, my God.

1109
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,255
Gigi, stop doing that!

1110
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:46,172
- What did you say?
- Molly loves Nick.

1111
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:48,463
Can you please stop
repeating that sentence?

1112
00:45:48,547 --> 00:45:49,963
Because it's not true.

1113
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,505
- Molly hates Nick.
- Thank you.

1114
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:54,255
She projects disgust
to cover up a deep desire.

1115
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:56,713
No. No. N-O. Thanks.

1116
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:59,422
Uh, you actually... You drugged us
and tried to throw us off a boat.

1117
00:45:59,505 --> 00:46:00,672
I did. I did.

1118
00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:02,838
So nothing you say is of any value to us.

1119
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:04,797
So-- Oh, you're...

1120
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,380
Yeah, no, you can stop flipping me off

1121
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,422
because you should flip off,
so shut the fuck up.

1122
00:46:08,505 --> 00:46:11,422
Madam Mayor, what are you doing out here?

1123
00:46:11,505 --> 00:46:13,047
George locked himself in the closet.

1124
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:13,963
Fuck!

1125
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,463
Dude.

1126
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,713
No.

1127
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:20,672
Dude?

1128
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,797
No.

1129
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:24,880
I don't like him.

1130
00:46:25,963 --> 00:46:27,755
Yes, maybe he is...

1131
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,297
classically, traditionally handsome
and weirdly charming,

1132
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,880
and maybe my innate biology
registers him as an ideal mate,

1133
00:46:34,963 --> 00:46:38,255
and yes, maybe I occasionally fantasize
about him sweeping me off my feet.

1134
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:41,297
And some weaker people
might call that a tiny crush,

1135
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,380
but I can ignore it,
I can fight against it,

1136
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:45,213
because we all have weird interests.

1137
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:47,630
And the important thing is
that we just... we shove 'em down

1138
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:49,380
and we never speak about them again.

1139
00:46:50,797 --> 00:46:52,672
You don't have to shove anything down.

1140
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,588
Yeah.

1141
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:58,297
Yeah. Yeah, I do,
because I can't like him.

1142
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,130
Maybe my body can like him
but my mind knows that that's stupid,

1143
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,880
because he's just... he's a jock,

1144
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:05,963
and all he cares about
is being cool and having fun,

1145
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,880
and he doesn't even look at girls
unless they look like Triple A.

1146
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:11,880
And he definitely doesn't want me
because I'm a butter personality.

1147
00:47:13,338 --> 00:47:16,380
How dare you say that
about my best friend?

1148
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:17,755
Amy, you fucking slapped me--

1149
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,005
If you ever say anything like that
about yourself again,

1150
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,963
I will fucking lay you out, okay?

1151
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,963
You are the strongest, coolest,

1152
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,047
smartest, most stunningly
gorgeous creature

1153
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,172
this high school and this Earth

1154
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:30,255
has ever seen.

1155
00:47:30,338 --> 00:47:34,838
And Nick Howland would be so fucking lucky
to be a footnote in your story.

1156
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:36,880
So we're going to his party.

1157
00:47:36,963 --> 00:47:38,047
Are you serious?

1158
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,297
I am dead serious.

1159
00:47:40,297 --> 00:47:42,713
If Nick's what you want,
then that's what you deserve.

1160
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:47,172
How? How are we gonna find out
where the party is?

1161
00:47:47,755 --> 00:47:49,130
By doing what we do best.

1162
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:51,713

are just one cheese and one sausage pizza,

1187
00:48:56,422 --> 00:48:58,005
you fucking morons.

1188
00:48:58,088 --> 00:48:58,922
Jesus.

1196
00:49:12,547 --> 00:49:14,005
Fuck! What the fuck is this?

1197
00:49:14,088 --> 00:49:16,338
- We ask the questions!
- Oh, my God.

1198
00:49:16,422 --> 00:49:18,422
Oh, shit, shit!
Is this some Manson family shit?

1199
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:19,922
- What is this?
- No!

1200
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:22,588
No! Everything is gonna be just fine!

1201
00:49:22,672 --> 00:49:26,172
You're just gonna give us the address to
where you delivered some pizzas tonight.

1202
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:31,505
Oh, my God. Are you guys out of your
fucking mind? How old are you, by the way?

1203
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:33,380
- Uh--
- Does not matter!

1204
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:35,422
Okay, that voice did not
make you sound older.

1205
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:37,088
So you're basically children,

1206
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:39,547
and you just willingly got in the car
of a strange man.

1207
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,005
Do you guys have a weapon?

1208
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:42,505
Yes?

1209
00:49:42,755 --> 00:49:45,380
If we claim to have a weapon,
this might be a felony.

1210
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,713
Fuck.

1211
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,713
- Yes.
- Okay, so you're using your hair as a mask

1212
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:51,672
and trying to rob someone with no weapon.

1213
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,922
'Cause the funny thing is,

1214
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:55,338
- I actually have a weapon.
- Fuck!

1215
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:57,130
- Dear God, no! You have a gun?
- Fuck! No!

1216
00:49:57,213 --> 00:50:00,172
I keep that to protect myself
from bad people,

1217
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:01,755
something you guys should think about.

1218
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,338
Did the... did the possibility
of sexual assault ever enter your minds?

1219
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:07,005
Not really.

1220
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,797
Yeah, not really, I can tell.

1221
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,213
You were spendin' more time on,
like, the hair

1222
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,505
and that... that whole part of it,
maybe, yeah.

1223
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:16,213
'Cause... 'cause we're like...
right by the freeway.

1224
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:19,005
I could have you across the state line
in, like, 40 minutes,

1225
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,880
take you to some cabin,
hog tie your ankles,

1226
00:50:21,963 --> 00:50:23,880
leave you in a room
with, like, a saucer of milk

1227
00:50:23,963 --> 00:50:25,922
and videotape the whole thing
for a couple days.

1228
00:50:26,005 --> 00:50:27,088
- What?
- What?

1229
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:28,088
- No.
- Think about that.

1230
00:50:28,172 --> 00:50:30,005
- What?
- No, I'm not gonna think about--

1231
00:50:30,088 --> 00:50:31,713
We just need you to give us the address

1232
00:50:31,797 --> 00:50:34,172
to where you delivered
this huge order tonight.

1233
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:37,297
Oh, shit, that p...

1234
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,672
Okay, you know what?

1235
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:45,213
Let me give you the address.

1236
00:50:45,297 --> 00:50:46,547
I feel like if I don't...

1237
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,380
...you guys are so stupid,

1238
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:52,297
some dog walker's gonna find
your bodies tomorrow under some overpass.

1239
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,088
- Okay.
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

1240
00:50:54,172 --> 00:50:56,005
- Don't show me your pass code!
- Oh, that's fair!

1241
00:50:56,088 --> 00:50:58,338
- Okay, sorry.
- That's the whole thing with pass codes.

1242
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,880
I'm just copying the address.

1243
00:50:59,963 --> 00:51:02,005
That's your private information.

1244
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:04,713
- Thank you!
- Thank you so much!

1245
00:51:04,797 --> 00:51:06,088
Oh, my God!

1246
00:51:06,172 --> 00:51:07,005
Um...

1247
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:08,463
Quick Q.

1248
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:11,922
Now that we're already in your car,
would you mind driving us there?

1249
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:14,463
Yeah, why not?

1250
00:51:14,547 --> 00:51:16,338
- Oh, great!
- I'm being sarcastic!

1251
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:17,922
- Get the fuck out of my car!
- Oh!

1252
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:19,297
- Okay!
- Thank you so much!

1253
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,880
Don't trust people. Oh, my God.

1254
00:51:23,255 --> 00:51:25,672
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, my God!

1255
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:29,130
- Oh!
- You were incredible! You were so scary.

1256
00:51:29,213 --> 00:51:32,380
If you were a criminal, you'd be
the best fucking criminal in Los Angeles.

1257
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:33,463
Aaah! Oh!

1258
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:36,213
Okay. Great, let's call a chariot.

1259
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,463
Fuck! I left my phone in his car!

1260
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,630
Why did I have to use a visual aid?

1261
00:51:44,713 --> 00:51:45,922
- Wait!
- It's okay!

1262
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:49,172
Amy, Amy, we will get it tomorrow.
It's fine. I'll use mine. I'll use mine.

1263
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:52,380
I'm at two percent?
Why the fuck am I at two percent?

1264
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,005
Why is my battery so low?

1265
00:51:54,547 --> 00:51:57,755
The porn. We streamed a lot of porn.

1266
00:51:58,172 --> 00:51:59,588
Just-- Just-- Just call a Lyft.

1267
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:01,130
No, I can't call a Lyft,

1268
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,922
because if my phone dies and the driver
can't contact us, we are fucked!

1269
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,547
Unless...

1270
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,005
- Pick up, pick up.
- Who are you calling?

1271
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,755
Hi, it's Molly and Amy. We're
at Lido's Pizza on Victory Boulevard.

1272
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:17,088
We are stranded.
Please pick us up, we need...

1273
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:20,338
It died.

1274
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,088
- We could hitchhike.
- Are you aching to be murdered?

1275
00:52:27,172 --> 00:52:29,380
Well, I'm just throwin' out
suggestions here.

1276
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:43,797
You girls need a ride?

1277
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:48,588
- Shotgun!
- I'll take the front!

1278
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,380
So cool! Just gonna--

1279
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:51,963
- Amy, what are you doing?
- No, I--

1280
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,922
My-- My legs are, like,
half an inch longer--

1281
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:56,338
Okay, you know I get car sick, Amy.
What-- Oh!

1282
00:52:56,422 --> 00:52:58,213
- Just let me go!
- You're embarrassing me.

1283
00:52:58,297 --> 00:52:59,838
- Stop--
- You're embarrassing me!

1284
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:02,505
Thank you so much, Miss Fine.
You totally saved us.

1285
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:05,338
Please. You two saved me
from re-watching <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

1286
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:07,422
I've seen it, like, 50 times.

1287
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:10,505
Okay, wait, so what is this address
I'm taking you to?

1288
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:12,422
It's, uh...
it's Nick Howland's aunt's house.

1289
00:53:12,505 --> 00:53:14,838
It's... It's... It's a party, technically.

1290
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:18,213
You two want me to drive you
to an unsupervised house party?

1291
00:53:18,297 --> 00:53:19,838
Oh... well...

1292
00:53:19,922 --> 00:53:23,005
Good. I'm glad you guys are having
some fun before graduation. Uh!

1293
00:53:24,422 --> 00:53:25,255
Really?

1294
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:28,880
Yes. Oh, my gosh, yes. I don't want
you guys to make the same mistake I did.

1295
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:30,088
What do you mean?

1296
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:32,047
I spent the majority of my 20s

1297
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,963
overcompensating for the fact
that I never had fun in high school.

1298
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:38,047
And, you know, the pendulum then swung
in a completely different direction.

1299
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,422
I mean, I went crazy.

1300
00:53:39,505 --> 00:53:41,797
I had some really dark moments
there in my 20s,

1301
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,088
like, some really dark moments.

1302
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:47,880
Like, it was bad.
You know I'm banned from Jamba Juice?

1303
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:51,213
Like, not a single Jamba Juice,
like every Jamba Juice.

1304
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,630
That came down from corporate.

1305
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:55,213
Do you know how many Jamba Juices
there are in this country?

1306
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:56,588
Like, a bajillion.

1307
00:53:56,755 --> 00:53:58,922
It's a national chain, it's a sensation.

1308
00:53:59,005 --> 00:54:01,505
I cannot have another Mango-A-Go-Go
ever again.

1309
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,463
But, look, I don't want that for you.

1310
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:05,422
Okay? You still have a chance.

1311
00:54:05,505 --> 00:54:07,922
I want you two to go to this party,
and I want you to have fun.

1312
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:10,088
Because tonight is your night.

1313
00:54:10,172 --> 00:54:11,047
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

1314
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:11,963
Okay.

1315
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:12,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

1316
00:54:12,963 --> 00:54:15,630
So, what are you two wearing?

1317
00:54:15,713 --> 00:54:17,005
Uh, we were thinking...

1318
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,005
uh...

1319
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,797
Well, just this...

1320
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,630
this-- this, uh... this look.

1321
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:23,505
You do know you guys are matching, right?

1322
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:26,922
We added this embellishment here.

1323
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:30,255
Well, lucky for you two,
I'm a single woman livin' in Los Angeles,

1324
00:54:30,338 --> 00:54:32,713
so I got a lot of shit in this car.

1325
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:34,838
Why don't y'all go through
some of those bags?

1326
00:54:34,922 --> 00:54:36,380
I'm sorry, we can touch your clothes?

1327
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:38,255
Yes, please. Please, touch my clothes.

1328
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:40,047
- Please get a change of clothes.
- This night!

1329
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,838
- Um...
- Um...

1330
00:54:48,922 --> 00:54:49,922
- Oh...
- Mmm...

1331
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:52,463
Mmm...

1332
00:54:52,547 --> 00:54:53,630
- I have no breath.
- What?

1333
00:54:53,713 --> 00:54:54,630
Excuse me?

1334
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:56,463
- Sorry, what?
- I have nowhere to go with this.

1335
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:58,630
- It's too perfect.
- You are literally glowing.

1336
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,172
You've hit the level of perfection
and now I'm just--

1337
00:55:01,255 --> 00:55:03,255
- Be still my heart.
- You just came out of the water.

1338
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:05,505
You're fresh from the water,
you're a mermaid here.

1339
00:55:05,588 --> 00:55:07,505
How are you so fucking shiny?

1340
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:09,422
Can you fetch me an inhaler?
I can't breathe.

1341
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,755
- Um, my eyes. Ow, ow!
- I'm physically unable--

1342
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:14,047
Ow, my eyes hurt so bad
from your beauty.

1343
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,630
- Um, exsqueeze me, ladies.
- Oh.

1344
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,755
- Oh, sorry.
- There's a... a party to get to.

1345
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:21,630
- All right.
- I will see you two inside, all right?

1346
00:55:21,713 --> 00:55:23,422
Just kidding. Imagine if I did, though.

1347
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:25,338
- Just kidding.
- Imagine if I just went in.

1348
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,338
That'd be weird, right?

1349
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:28,130
That'd be so fun.

1350
00:55:28,213 --> 00:55:30,422
- Anyway, see y'all later.
- Okay, bye.

1351
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:39,088
Phew.

Oh, right, that-- Hang out.

You remembered I'm going to Africa?

1404
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:54,505
Of course. Aren't you gonna go to,
like, Uganda or something?

1405
00:58:54,588 --> 00:58:57,297
Botswana. They'd kill me in Uganda.

1406
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:58,213
Why?

1407
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:00,588

make sure they don't kill themselves.

- Yeah.

- No, I'm not... I'm not gonna move.

Did you guys go in the pool?

1565
01:08:07,797 --> 01:08:09,213
- What's going on?
- Molly--

1566
01:08:09,297 --> 01:08:11,963
Things are going so well over here,
like really, really, really well.

1567
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,672
I'm being so mean to him,
but it's working.

1568
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:15,838
We talked about <i>Harry Potter.</i>
He knows I'm a Slytherin.

1569
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:17,797
- He seems to like it.
- I think we should go home.

1570
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,922
Wait, what? No. Just... just dry off.

1571
01:08:20,005 --> 01:08:22,130
No, I think we need to leave.
Come on, let's go.

1572
01:08:22,213 --> 01:08:23,755
Are you nuts? No. He...

1573
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:24,755
- Nick is fully...
- No.

1574
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:26,172
He's fully flirting with me.

1575
01:08:26,255 --> 01:08:27,297
This actually might happen.

1576
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,963
- Listen to me, this might happen.
- No, no.

1577
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:31,130
Molly, please, I'm asking you,
let's just go, okay?

1578
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:33,630
- Ame, just go find Ryan. It'll be great.
- Malala!

1579
01:08:35,005 --> 01:08:35,922
Amy, no.

1580
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:39,963
- Are you kidding?
- No, I--

1581
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:43,880
I've done whatever you wanted all night,
and I'm calling Malala, so come with me.

1582
01:08:43,963 --> 01:08:46,880
No, I'm not leaving just because
you're doing the thing that you always do.

1583
01:08:48,713 --> 01:08:50,130
What is that supposed to mean?

1584
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,797
Just... You...

1585
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:55,380
You talk a big game, and then you give up
just when things get uncomfortable.

1586
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:58,338
Like you jumped in the pool, and now
you're sad that you're wet, like...

1587
01:08:58,422 --> 01:09:00,297
- That's bullshit, Moll, that's bullshit.
- No--

1588
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:02,713
If I didn't drag you to do things,
you just wouldn't do them.

1589
01:09:02,797 --> 01:09:04,297
You... you... you don't drag me.

1590
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,922
You force me to do
whatever you want to do.

1591
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,672
What does that even mean?

1592
01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:11,838
You decide what we do and when we do it,

1593
01:09:11,922 --> 01:09:13,505
and then we always
have to do it together,

1594
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:14,797
- all the time.
- I have to decide

1595
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,588
because you literally decide nothing.

1596
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:18,713
Like, I do all the heavy lifting
in our friendship.

1597
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:21,172
- You never take charge.
- I take charge all the time!

1598
01:09:21,255 --> 01:09:22,713
You never take charge!

1599
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:25,797
I always have to push you.
Without me, you wouldn't do anything.

1600
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,380
- I'm going to Africa without you.
- Yeah, I encouraged your summer abroad.

1601
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:31,547
I'm not going for the summer.

1602
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,963
I'm going for the entire year.

1603
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:37,713
What?

1604
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:41,672
I'm taking a gap year.

1605
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:44,338
I deferred Columbia until next fall.

1606
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:46,422
When did you decide that?

1607
01:09:46,505 --> 01:09:47,505
When I applied.

1608
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:52,047
In January? You've been lying to me
since January?

1609
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:55,213
Yeah, because I knew if I told you,
you'd bully me into staying.

1610
01:09:55,297 --> 01:09:57,380
So all our schedules are gonna be off now.

1611
01:09:57,463 --> 01:09:58,838
We're not gonna graduate together,

1612
01:09:58,922 --> 01:10:00,672
not gonna go
on a post-college trip together,

1613
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,922
we're not gonna move to DC together,
our whole plan--

1614
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:04,505
That was your plan!

1615
01:10:04,588 --> 01:10:05,547
That was never my plan.

1616
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,547
- It's always your plan!
- I can't believe you!

1617
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:09,422
You think
that going to Africa makes you tough,

1618
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,880
and you weren't even fucking brave enough
to tell me about it!

1619
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:13,338
You're a fucking coward, Amy!

1620
01:10:13,422 --> 01:10:14,713

1623
01:11:06,797 --> 01:11:07,672
What the fuck?

1624
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:11,172
I locked that.

1625
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:17,755
Well, I guess you didn't.

1626
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:19,963

01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,505

1628
01:11:21,588 --> 01:11:23,422

1629
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:25,047
leave me alone?

1630
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:26,505
Why are you even at a party?

1631
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,005
Shouldn't you be, like, marching
in some meaningless protest somewhere,

1632
01:11:30,088 --> 01:11:32,338
or, I don't know,
in your bed doing homework?

1633
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,963
You don't even know me.

1634
01:11:34,047 --> 01:11:36,130
- Pretty sure I do.
- No.

1635

- I'll explain later.

1859
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,963
- Am I driving?
- Of course you're driving!

1860

- Oh, that was my fault!

'Cause I haven't seen her either
since yesterday

1898
01:26:12,463 --> 01:26:14,505
when we were at school, all of us,
at school together.

1899
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:16,588
So, Molly warned me
she might be a little late

1900
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,005
and tapped me to start her speech.

1901
01:26:18,088 --> 01:26:20,338
- Molly is gonna be late to graduation?
- Yeah.

1902
01:26:20,422 --> 01:26:22,297
- That doesn't sound like her.
- Right.

1903
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,755
Well, uh, she also asked me
to remind you that... um...

1904
01:26:26,630 --> 01:26:27,463
um...

1905
01:26:27,547 --> 01:26:28,463
I got it, uh...

1906
01:26:28,922 --> 01:26:31,838
This sort of thing happens all the time
on the Senate floor.

1907
01:26:31,922 --> 01:26:33,922
And if a senator isn't present for a vote,

1908
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:36,880
- a proxy can call for a motion...
- Okay. That does sound like her.

1909
01:26:36,963 --> 01:26:39,255
- ...for the vote to take place...
- I got it. Thanks, Jared.

1910
01:26:39,338 --> 01:26:40,547
- ...in her absence.
- Okay, so...

1911
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,630
So she tapped you?

1912
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:43,088
- Tapped me.
- Okay.

1913
01:26:43,922 --> 01:26:46,755
Yeah, fuck it, I approve, you're up.
You're gonna kick it off.

1914
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:49,422
- Oh. Oh.
- Okay, there he goes.

Things are never gonna be the same,
but... it was perfect.

1959
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,047
And-- And I may not have before, but...

1960
01:29:42,588 --> 01:29:43,922
I see you now.

Where?

2030
01:32:44,047 --> 01:32:47,005
I don't know. Honestly, anywhere
I can find a couch to crash on.

2031
01:32:47,088 --> 01:32:49,880
I just... you know, I wanna see some stuff
before college.

2032
01:32:50,588 --> 01:32:52,047
That's... that's really cool.

2033
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:54,588
Me too, that's...
that's why I'm taking a gap year.

2034
01:32:55,088 --> 01:32:55,922
Yeah?

2035
01:32:56,338 --> 01:32:57,338
Yeah.

2036
01:32:57,422 --> 01:32:58,255
Yeah.

2037
01:32:58,338 --> 01:32:59,588

2038
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,088
have fun, nerd.

2039
01:33:09,672 --> 01:33:13,047
Um, well, if-- if you ever end up in...
in Botswana...

2040
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:16,005
you'd have a couch to crash on.

2041
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:17,463
Okay.

2042
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:22,213
Well, technically, it won't be my couch,
'cause I'll be staying with a family,

2043
01:33:22,297 --> 01:33:24,505
- but I'm sure they'll be cool with it.
- Okay.

2044
