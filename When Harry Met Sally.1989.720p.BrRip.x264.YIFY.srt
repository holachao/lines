1
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:18,670
I was sitting with my friend
Arthur Kornblum in a restaurant.

2
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:21,953
It was the Horn & Hardert Cafeteria.

3
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:24,732
And this beautiful girl
walked in,

4
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:27,611
and I turned to Arthur,
and I said,

5
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:30,038
"Arthur, you see that girl?

6
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,812
I'm going to marry her."

7
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,567
And two weeks later,
we were married.

8
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:38,130
And it's over 50 years later...

9
00:02:38,194 --> 00:02:40,249
and we're still married.

10
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:57,270
- I love you.
- I love you.

11
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,343
Hmm...

12
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,641
Oh, hi, Sally.

13
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:36,260
Sally, this is Harry Burns.
Harry, this is Sally Albright.

14
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:37,841
Nice to meet you.

15
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:41,491
- You want to drive the first shift?
- No, you're there already. You can start.

16
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,098
Back's open.

17
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,257
- Call me.
- I'll call you as soon as I get there.

18
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,015
Oh, call me from the road.

19
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,740
I'll call you before then.

20
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,889
- I love you.
- I love you.

21
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:00,499
Sorry.

22
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:04,174
- I miss you already.
- I miss you.

23
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,106
- Bye.
- Bye.

24
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:26,212
I have it all figured out.
It's an 18-hour trip

25
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,504
which breaks down into six shifts
of three hours each,

26
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,023
or alternatively
we could break it down by mileage.

27
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:35,962
There's a map on the visor

28
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:39,842
that I've marked to show the locations
where we can change shifts.

29
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,721
Grape?

30
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,754
No. I don't like to eat
between meals.

31
00:04:48,925 --> 00:04:50,790
I'll roll down the window.

32
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,550
Why don't you tell me
the story of your life.

33
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:08,359
- The story of my life?
- We got 18 hours to kill before we hit New York.

34
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,828
The story of my life isn't even
gonna get us out of Chicago.

35
00:05:10,854 --> 00:05:12,587
I mean nothing's happened to me yet.

36
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:13,978
That's why I'm going to New York.

37
00:05:14,004 --> 00:05:15,484
- So something'll happen to you?
- Yes.

38
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:16,380
Like what?

39
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,436
Like I'm going to journalism school
to become a reporter.

40
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:22,410
So you can write about things
that happen to other people.

41
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:26,405
- That's one way to look at it.
- Suppose nothing happens to you?

42
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,571
Suppose you live there your whole life and nothing happens?

43
00:05:28,635 --> 00:05:30,579
You never meet anybody,
You never become anything.

44
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,392
And finally you die one of those New York deaths...

45
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:36,053
where nobody notices for two weeks
until the smell drifts into the hallway.

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,824
- Amanda mentioned you had a dark side.
- That's what drew her to me.

47
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:45,239
- Your dark side?
- Sure. Why, don't you have a dark side?

48
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,261
I know, you're probably one of those cheerful
people who dots their "I's" with hearts.

49
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,967
I have just as much of a dark side
as the next person.

50
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:53,047
Oh, really?

51
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,654
When I buy a new book,
I always read the last page first.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,337
That way, in case I die
before I finish, I know how it ends.

53
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,041
That, my friend, is a dark side.

54
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:03,783
That doesn't mean you're deep or anything.
I mean,

55
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:06,452
- Yes, basically I'm a happy person.
- So am I.

56
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,513
And I don't see that there's anything wrong with that.

57
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:11,952
Of course not. You're too busy being happy.
You ever think about death?

58
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,247
- Yes.
- Sure you do.

59
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,965
A fleeting thought that drifts
in and out of the transom of your mind.

60
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,741
I spend hours,
I spend days (to think about death).

61
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:19,651
And you think this makes you a better person?

62
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,055
Look, when the shit comes down,
I'm gonna be prepared, and you're not.

63
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:23,873
That's all I'm saying.

64
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:27,214
In the meantime, you're gonna ruin
your whole life waiting for it.

65
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,649
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

66
00:06:37,675 --> 00:06:39,979
He wants her to leave.
That's why he puts her on the plane.

67
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:43,249
- I don't think she wants to stay.
- Of course she wants to stay.

68
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,083
Wouldn't you rather be with
Humphrey Bogart than the other guy?

69
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,489
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life in Casablanca,

70
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:51,572
married to a man who runs a bar.

71
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:54,079
That probably sounds very snobbish to you,
but I don't.

72
00:06:54,237 --> 00:06:57,894
- You'd rather be in a passionless marriage
- And be the first lady of Czechoslovakia.

73
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,743
... than live with a man you've had
the greatest sex of your life with,

74
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:03,485
just because he owns a bar
and that is all he does?

75
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:04,605
Yes.

76
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,347
And so would any woman
in her right mind.

77
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,942
Women are very practical,
even Ingrid Bergman,

78
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,750
which is why she gets on the plane
at the end of the movie.

79
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:18,253
I understand.

80
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:20,723
What? What?

81
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:22,773
- Nothing.
- What?

82
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:24,778
Forget about it.

83
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:26,442
- Forget about what?
- It's not important.

84
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:28,399
No, just tell me.

85
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:32,010
Obviously you haven't had great sex yet.

86
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,607
- Two, please.
- Right over there.

87
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,703
- Yes, I have.
- No, you haven't.

88
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,850
It just so happens that I have had
plenty of good sex.

89
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,564
With whom?

90
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:02,332
What?

91
00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:04,991
With whom did you have
this great sex?

92
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,309
I'm not gonna tell you that.

93
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,262
Fine. Don't tell me.

94
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,230
Shel Gordon.

95
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,482
Shel? Sheldon?

96
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:22,082
No. No, you did not have
great sex with Sheldon.

97
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,456
- I did too.
- No, you didn't.

98
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,156
Sheldon can do your income taxes.

99
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,601
If you need a root canal,
Sheldon's your man.

100
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,997
But humping and pumping
is not Sheldon's strong suit.

101
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,961
It's the name.
"Do it to me, Sheldon.

102
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:35,501
You're an animal, Sheldon.

103
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,589
Ride me, big Sheldon."

104
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,191
It doesn't work.

105
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:40,039
Hi.

106
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:43,268
- What can I get you?
- I'll have a number 3.

107
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,041
I'd like the chef's salad, please,
with the oil and vinegar on the side,

108
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:48,622
and the apple pie ?la mode.

109
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,151
Chef and apple ?la mode.

110
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,912
But I'd like the pie heated, and I dont' want
 the ice cream on top, I want it on the side.

111
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,278
And I'd like strawberry instead of vanilla,
if you have it.

112
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,871
If not, then no ice cream,
just whipped cream, but only if it's real.

113
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:02,416
If it's out of a can, then nothing.

114
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:03,720
Not even the pie?

115
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:06,426
No, just the pie,
but then not heated.

116
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,957
Uh huh.

117
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

118
00:09:14,477 --> 00:09:16,342
Nothing, nothing.

119
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,983
So how come you broke
up with Sheldon?

120
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,571
How do you know we broke up?

121
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,021
Because if you didn't break up,
you wouldn't be here with me.

122
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,248
You'd be off with Sheldon,
the Wonder Schlong.

123
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,406
First of all, I am not "with" you.

124
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,889
And second of all, it is none
of your business why we broke up.

125
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,811
You're right.
I don't wanna know.

126
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:43,133
Well if you must know,
it was because he was very jealous,

127
00:09:43,206 --> 00:09:45,265
and I had these
"Days of the Week" underpants.

128
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:48,444
I'm sorry.
I need a judge's ruling on this.

129
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:50,168
"Days of the Week" underpants?

130
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:52,628
Yes. They had
the days of the week on them,

131
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,503
and I thought they were sorta funny.

132
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:58,295
And then, one day, Sheldon says to me,
"You never wear Sunday."

133
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:01,471
He's all suspicious.
Where was Sunday? Where had I left Sunday?

134
00:10:01,582 --> 00:10:03,935
And I told him,
and he didn't believe me.

135
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:07,116
- What?
- They don't make Sunday.

136
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,799
- Why not?
- Because of God.

137
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,320
Okay, so 15 percent of my share

138
00:10:17,346 --> 00:10:19,253
is 90.

139
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,610
6.90.

140
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:26,645
Let's leave 7.

141
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:31,285
What?

142
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,899
Do I have something on my face?

143
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,070
You're a very attractive person.

144
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,328
Thank you.

145
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,660
Amanda never said
how attractive you were.

146
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:47,028
Well, maybe she doesn't think I'm attractive.

147
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:51,662
I don't think it's a matter of opinion.
Empirically, you are attractive.

148
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,607
Amanda is my friend.

149
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,171
So?

150
00:10:57,678 --> 00:11:00,167
- So you're going with her.
- So?

151
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,740
So you're coming on to me.

152
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:04,842
No, I wasn't.

153
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,867
What?

154
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,131
Can't a man say a woman is attractive
without it being a come-on?

155
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:13,880
All right, all right.

156
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:18,681
Let's just say, just for the sake
of argument, that it was a come-on.

157
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,809
What do you want me to do about it?
I take it back, okay?

158
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,303
- You can't take it back.
- Why not?

159
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,157
Because it's already out there.

160
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:30,993
Oh, Geez, what are we supposed to do?
Call the cops. It's already out there.

161
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:34,705
Just let it lie.
Okay?

162
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:36,753
Great. Let it lie.

163
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,793
That's my policy.

164
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:42,117
That's what I always say:
Let it lie.

165
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,095
Wanna spend the night in a motel?

166
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,796
See what I did?
I didn't let it lie.

167
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:46,238
Harry.

168
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:47,760
- I said I would, then I didn't.
- Harry.

169
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,858
- I went the other way.
- Harry.

170
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:49,381
What?

171
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:52,661
We are just going
to be friends, okay?

172
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:55,300
Great. Friends.
It's the best thing.

173
00:11:56,704 --> 00:11:59,366
You realize, of course, that we
could never be friends.

174
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:00,801
Why not?

175
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:05,420
What I'm saying is,
and this is not a come-on in any way, shape or form,

176
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:10,140
is that men and women can't be friends
because the sex part always gets in the way.

177
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,315
That's not true.

178
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:16,480
I have a number of men friends,
and there is no sex involved.

179
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,792
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

180
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,167
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

181
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:20,447
You only think you do.

182
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,801
You're saying I'm having sex
with these men without my knowledge?

183
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:26,015
No. What I'm saying is,
they all wanna have sex with you.

184
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,975
- They do not.
- Do too.

185
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:29,485
- They do not.
- Do too.

186
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,338
How do you know?

187
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,299
Because no man can be friends
with a woman that he finds attractive.

188
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,534
He always wants
to have sex with her.

189
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,457
So you're saying that a man can be friends
with a woman he finds unattractive.

190
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:44,211
No. You pretty much
wanna nail 'em too.

191
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:48,532
What if they don't want
to have sex with you?

192
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:50,981
Doesn't matter, because the sex thing
is already out there,

193
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:54,043
so the friendship is ultimately doomed,
and that is the end of the story.

194
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:57,820
- Well, I guess we're not gonna be friends then.
- Guess not.

195
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,556
That's too bad.

196
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,054
You were the only person
that I knew in New York.

197
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:45,115
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah. It was interesting.

198
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,878
- (It) was nice knowing you.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,342
Well, have a nice life.

200
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:01,508
You too.

201
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:20,878
We fell in love in high school.

202
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:23,276
Yeah, we were high school sweethearts.

203
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:26,402
But then after our junior year,
his parents moved away.

204
00:14:26,577 --> 00:14:28,587
But I never forgot her.

205
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,590
He never forgot me.

206
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:34,166
Her face was burned on my brain.

207
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:37,961
And it was 34 years later
that I was walking down Broadway,

208
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:40,321
and I saw her
come out of Toffenetti's.

209
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:42,112
We both looked at each other...

210
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:46,830
and it was just as though
not a single day had gone by.

211
00:14:47,007 --> 00:14:50,647
She was just as beautiful
as she was at 16.

212
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:53,044
He was just the same.

213
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,678
He looked exactly the same.

214
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:31,211
Joe! I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

215
00:15:31,285 --> 00:15:33,378
- Harry Burns.
- Harry, how're you doin'?

216
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:35,819
- Good. How (are) you doing?
- Fine. I'm doing fine.

217
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:36,441
Yeah, that's great.

218
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,303
I was just walking by
and I thought it was you.

219
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:39,148
And here it is, it's you.

220
00:15:39,174 --> 00:15:40,718
Yeah, yeah, it was.

221
00:15:40,744 --> 00:15:41,851
You still with the D.A.'s office?

222
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:45,065
No. I switched to the other side.
What about you?

223
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:47,351
I work with a small firm.
We do political consulting.

224
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,662
- Uh huh.
- Yeah, it's great.

225
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:49,327
Yeah.

226
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,166
Oh, Harry, this is Sally Albright.
Harry Burns.

227
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:57,094
Harry and I, we used to...
We lived in the same building.

228
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,375
Well, listen, I got a plane to catch.
It was really good to see you, Joe.

229
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,868
- You too, Harry.
- Bye.

230
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:13,136
Thank God he couldn't place me.

231
00:16:13,162 --> 00:16:15,499
I drove from college to New York
with him five years ago,

232
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:18,459
and it was the longest night
of my life.

233
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:21,248
What happened?

234
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,353
He made a pass at me,
and when I said no,

235
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,051
he was going with
a girlfriend of mine.

236
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:30,203
Oh, God,
I can't remember her name.

237
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:31,783
Don't get involved with me, Joe.

238
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,762
I'm 26 years old, and I can't even remember the name
of the girl I was such good friends with,

239
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:37,883
I wouldn't get involved
with her boyfriend.

240
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:40,044
So what happened?

241
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,884
- When?
- When he made a pass at you, you said no?

242
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,894
Oh, oh.

243
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:46,145
I said we could just be friends.

244
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,197
And this part I remember. He said that men
and women could never really be friends.

245
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,227
Do you think that's true?

246
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,433
No.

247
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,803
Do you have any women friends?
Just friends?

248
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:01,338
No.

249
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,931
But I will get one
if it's important to you.

250
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,019
Amanda Reese.

251
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:11,650
That was her name.
Thank God!

252
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,310
I will miss you.

253
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,344
I love you.

254
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,254
You do?

255
00:17:18,025 --> 00:17:19,390
Yes.

256
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:22,219
I love you.

257
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,381
And what would you like to drink?

258
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:50,022
- Nothing, thanks.
- Do you have any Bloody Mary mix?

259
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,243
- Yes.
- No, wait. Here's what I want:

260
00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:56,004
Regular tomato juice,
filled up about three quarters.

261
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,692
Then add just a splash
of Bloody Mary mix, just a splash,

262
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:00,813
and a piece of lime,
but on the side.

263
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,882
The University of Chicago, right?

264
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:05,255
Yes.

265
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,672
Did you look this good
at the University of Chicago?

266
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:09,582
- No.
- Did we ever...

267
00:18:10,764 --> 00:18:12,264
No, no.

268
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,589
We drove from Chicago to New York
together after graduation.

269
00:18:17,651 --> 00:18:18,874
Would you two like
to sit together?

270
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,090
- No.
- Great! Thank you.

271
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:29,563
You were a good friend of...

272
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:31,203
Amanda's.

273
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:34,007
I can't believe
you can't remember her name.

274
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,293
What do you mean?
I can remember.

275
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:36,744
 Amanda, right?
Amanda Rice.

276
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,490
- Reese.
- Reese, right. That's what I said.

277
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:39,484
What ever happened to her?

278
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,356
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea?

279
00:18:42,464 --> 00:18:45,720
You were really good friends with her.
We didn't make it because you were such good friends.

280
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:47,990
- You went with her.
- And was it worth it?

281
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:50,573
The sacrifice for a friend that
you don't even keep in touch with?

282
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,972
Harry, you might not believe this,

283
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,804
but I never considered
not sleeping with you a sacrifice.

284
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,428
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

285
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:05,207
- You were gonna be a gymnast.
- A journalist.

286
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,105
Right, that's what I said.
And?

287
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,373
I am a journalist.
I work at The News.

288
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:11,608
Great. And you're with Joe.

289
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:13,650
Well, that's great.

290
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,706
Great. You're together what,
three weeks?

291
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,549
A month.
How did you know that?

292
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:23,560
You take someone to the airport,
it's clearly at the beginning of a relationship.

293
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,688
That's why I've never taken
anyone to the airport

294
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,632
at the beginning of a relationship.

295
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:28,670
Why?

296
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,966
Because eventually things move on,
and you don't take someone to the airport

297
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,692
and I never wanted anyone
to say to me,

298
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,200
"How come you never take me
to the airport anymore?"

299
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,108
It's amazing.
You look like a normal person,

300
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,640
but actually you are
the Angel of Death.

301
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,681
Are you gonna marry him?

302
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,669
We have only known
each other for a month,

303
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:50,467
and besides, neither one of us
is looking to get married right now.

304
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,361
- Hmm, I'm getting married.
- You are?

305
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:54,077
Mm hmm.

306
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,815
- You are?
- Yeah.

307
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,128
Who is she?

308
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,203
Helen Hillson. She's a lawyer.
She's keeping her name.

309
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,803
- You're getting married?
- Yeah.

310
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,934
What's so funny about that?

311
00:20:12,287 --> 00:20:14,473
It's just so optimistic of you, Harry.

312
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:17,293
Well, you'd be amazed what falling
madly in love can do for you.

313
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:20,923
Well, it's wonderful. It's nice to see you
embracing life in this manner.

314
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:24,980
Yeah. Plus, you konw, you just get to a certain point
where you get tired of the whole thing.

315
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,453
- What whole thing?
- The whole "life of a single guy" thing.

316
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,688
You meet someone.
You have the safe lunch.

317
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:33,153
You decide you like each other enough
to move on to dinner.

318
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,397
You go dancing.
You do the White Man's Overbite.

319
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,738
Go back to her place, you have sex,
and the minute you're finished,

320
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:40,905
you know what goes
through your mind?

321
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,902
"How long do I have to lie here
and hold her before I can get up and go home?

322
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,609
Is 30 seconds enough?"

323
00:20:47,311 --> 00:20:50,041
That's what you're thinking?
Is that true?

324
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:52,241
Sure.
All men think that.

325
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:56,043
How long do you like to be held
afterwards? All night, right?

326
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:57,302
See? That's the problem.

327
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,082
Somewhere between 30 seconds
and all night is your problem.

328
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,992
- I don't have a problem.
- Yeah, you do.

329
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:20,785
- Staying over?
- Yes.

330
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:24,386
Would you like to have dinner?
Just friends.

331
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,212
I thought you didn't believe
men and women could be friends.

332
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,284
- When did I say that?
- On the ride to New York.

333
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,095
No, no no no,
I never said that.

334
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,315
Yes, that's right.

335
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,089
They can't be friends, s

336
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:39,028
unless both of them are involved
with other people. Then they can.

337
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:41,030
This is an amendment
to the earlier rule.

338
00:21:41,098 --> 00:21:42,690
If two people are in relationships

339
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:45,819
the pressure of
possible involvement is lifted.

340
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:49,574
That doesn't work either, because what happens then
is the person you're involved with

341
00:21:49,638 --> 00:21:52,460
can't understand why you need to be friends
with the person you're just friends with,

342
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,968
like it means something is missing from the relationship
(and) you wanna get outside to get it.

343
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:59,178
Then when you say, "No, no no, it's not ture.
Nothing is missing from the relationship,"

344
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:01,331
the person you're involved with
then accuses you

345
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:03,962
of being secretly attracted to
the person you're just friends with,

346
00:22:03,988 --> 00:22:07,043
which you probably are. I mean, come on!
Who the hell are we kidding? Let's face it.

347
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,219
Which brings us back to early the rule
before the amendment,

348
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,343
which is men and women can't be friends.
So where's that leave us?

349
00:22:12,383 --> 00:22:13,712
- Harry?
- What?

350
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,488
Good bye.

351
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:27,665
I'll just stop walking.
I'll let you go ahead.

352
00:22:31,713 --> 00:22:33,798
We were married 40 years ago.

353
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:35,938
We were married three years,
we got a divorce.

354
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,203
- Then I married Marjorie.
- But first you lived with Barbara.

355
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:40,178
Right. Barbara.

356
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:42,879
But I didn't marry Barbara.
I married Marjorie.

357
00:22:43,106 --> 00:22:46,322
- Then he got a divorce.
- Right. Then I married Katie.

358
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:47,732
Another divorce.

359
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,854
Then a couple of years later
at Eddie Collecio's funeral,

360
00:22:51,028 --> 00:22:52,747
I ran into her.

361
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,743
I was with some girl
I don't even remember.

362
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:58,903
- Roberta.
- Right. Roberta.

363
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:01,186
But I couldn't take my eyes off you.

364
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,999
I remember I snuck over
to her and I said,

365
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,308
What did I say?

366
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:08,851
- You said, "What are you doing after?"
- Right.

367
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,817
So I ditched Roberta. We go for coffee.
A month later, we're married.

368
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,326
Thirty-five years to the day
after our first marriage.

369
00:23:19,563 --> 00:23:22,779
- I went through his pockets, Okay?
- Why would you wanna go through his pockets?

370
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:23,812
You know what I found?

371
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:24,514
No, what?

372
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,384
They just bought a dining room table.

373
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,575
He and his wife just went out and spent
$1,600 on a dining room table.

374
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:32,675
- Where?
- The point isn't where, Alice.

375
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,954
The point is,
he's never gonna leave her.

376
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,392
So what else is new.
You've known this for two years.

377
00:23:37,742 --> 00:23:40,061
You're right. You're right.
I know you're right.

378
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,579
Why can't you find someone single?

379
00:23:41,605 --> 00:23:44,142
When I was single,
I knew lots of nice single men.

380
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,691
There must be someone.

381
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:49,109
- Sally found someone.
- Well, Sally got the last good one.

382
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:50,868
Joe and I broke up.

383
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:51,610
What?

384
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,120
- When?
- Monday.

385
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,558
- You waited three days to tell us?
- You mean Joe's available?

386
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:56,881
For God's sakes, Marie!

387
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:59,880
Don't you have any feelings about this?
She's obviously upset.

388
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:02,953
I'm not that upset. We've been
growing apart for quite a while.

389
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,167
But you guys were a couple.
You had someone to go places with.

390
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,549
You had a date on national holidays!

391
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:12,378
I said to myself,
"You deserve more than this. You're 31 years old."

392
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:13,621
And the clock is ticking.

393
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:16,399
No, the clock doesn't really start to tick
until you're 36.

394
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,237
God, you're in such great shape.

395
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,588
Well, I've had a few days to get used to it,
and I feel okay.

396
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,891
Good. Then you're ready.

397
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,484
- Really, Marie!
- Well, how else do you think you do it?

398
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:31,767
I've got the perfect guy.

399
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,363
I don't happen to find him attractive,
but you might.

400
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,518
She doesn't have
a problem with chins.

401
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,613
Marie, I'm not ready yet.

402
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,533
but you just said
you were over him.

403
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:44,014
I am over him,
but I'm in a mourning period.

404
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,616
Who is it?

405
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,899
Alex Anderson.

406
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,657
You fixed me up
with him six years ago.

407
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:53,853
Uh, sorry.

408
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,921
God. All right.
Wait. Here.

409
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:59,255
Here we go.
Ken Darman.

410
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,953
He's been married for over a year.

411
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:03,466
Really?

412
00:25:04,322 --> 00:25:05,882
Married.

413
00:25:06,637 --> 00:25:08,855
- Oh, wait. Wait. I got one.
- Look,

414
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,908
there is no point in my going out
with someone I might really like,

415
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,809
if I met him at the right time,
but who right now has no chance

416
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,167
of being anything to me
but a transitional man.

417
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:17,952
Okay.

418
00:25:18,194 --> 00:25:19,923
But don't wait too long.

419
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:22,052
Remember what happened
with David Warsaw?

420
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,895
His wife left him, and everyone said,
"Give him some time.

421
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,713
Don't move in too fast."

422
00:25:27,057 --> 00:25:29,086
Six months later, he was dead.

423
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:33,298
What? You're saying I should get married to someone
right away in case he's about to die?

424
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,547
At least you could say
you were married.

425
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:39,456
I'm saying that the right man for you
might be out there right now.

426
00:25:39,518 --> 00:25:41,390
And if you don't grab him,
someone else will.

427
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,048
And you'll spend the rest of your life
knowing that someone else

428
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:46,006
is married to your husband.

429
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,338
Ten!

430
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:52,730
Hut!

431
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,379
When did this happen?

432
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:09,493
Friday.

433
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:12,193
Helen comes home from work,
and she says,

434
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:14,575
"I don't know if I wanna be married anymore."

435
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:17,315
Like it's the institution.
You know, like it's nothing personal,

436
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:20,347
just something she's been thinking
about in a casual way.

437
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,142
I'm calm. I say,

438
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:25,220
"Why don't we take some time to think about it?
You know, don't rush into anything."

439
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:26,061
Yeah, right.

440
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:30,314
Next day, she says she's thought about it
and she wants a trial separation.

441
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:33,336
She just wants to try it,
she says, but we can still date.

442
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:35,320
Like this is supposed
to cushion the blow.

443
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:37,261
I mean, I got married
so I could stop dating.

444
00:26:37,352 --> 00:26:39,897
So I don't see where we can still date
is any big incentive

445
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,056
since the last thing you wanna do
is date your wife

446
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:44,405
who's supposed to love you,
which is what I'm saying to her

447
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:47,013
when it occurs to me
that maybe she doesn't.

448
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:50,285
So I say to her,
"Don't you love me anymore?"

449
00:26:50,362 --> 00:26:53,564
Do you know what she says?
"I don't know if I've ever loved you."

450
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,958
Oooh! That's harsh.

451
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,066
You don't bounce back from that right away.

452
00:26:58,132 --> 00:26:58,990
Thanks, Jess.

453
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,827
No, I'm a writer. I know dialogue.
And that's particularly harsh.

454
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:06,392
Then she tells me that somebody in
her office is going to South America,

455
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,099
and she can sublet his apartment.

456
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:10,668
I can't believe this.
And the doorbell rings.

457
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,334
"I can sublet his apartment."

458
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,918
The words are still
hanging in the air,

459
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:15,906
 You know, like in a balloon
attached to a mouth...

460
00:27:15,932 --> 00:27:17,339
- Like in a cartoon.
- Right.

461
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:20,384
So I go to the door,
and there are moving men there.

462
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:22,215
Now I start to get suspicious.

463
00:27:22,588 --> 00:27:24,685
I say, "Helen, when did you call these movers?"

464
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,455
And she doesn't say anything.

465
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:29,301
So I ask the movers, "When did
this woman book you for this gig?"

466
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,411
And they're just standing there,
three huge guys,

467
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,529
one of them wearing a T-shirt that says,
"Don't fuck with Mr. Zero."

468
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,969
So I said, "Helen, when did
you make this arrangement?"

469
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,503
She says, "A week ago."

470
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:43,398
I said, "You've known for a week,
and you didn't tell me?"

471
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:46,583
And she says,
"I didn't want to ruin your birthday."

472
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:52,785
You're saying Mr. Zero knew you were getting
a divorce a week before you did?

473
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,607
- Mr. Zero knew.
- I can't believe this.

474
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,479
- I haven't told you the bad part yet.
- What could be worse than Mr. Zero knowing?

475
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,930
It's all a lie.

476
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,879
She's in love with somebody else.

477
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:07,342
Some tax attorney.
She moved in with him.

478
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:09,489
How did you find out?

479
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,299
I followed her.
I stood outside the building.

480
00:28:12,594 --> 00:28:15,245
- So humiliating.
- Tell me about it.

481
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,166
And, you know, I knew.

482
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,240
I knew the whole time that even though
we were happy, (it) was just an illusion,

483
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:22,381
and that one day
she would kick the shit out of me.

484
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:25,678
Marriages don't break up
on account of infidelity.

485
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:28,192
It's just a symptom
that something else is wrong.

486
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:31,675
Oh, really?
Well, that symptom is fucking my wife.

487
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,177
So I just happened to see
his American Express bill.

488
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:42,462
What do you mean
you "just happened to see it"?

489
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,541
Well, he was shaving,
and there it was, in his briefcase.

490
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:49,274
What if he came out and saw you
looking through his briefcase?

491
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,243
You're missing the point.
I'm telling you what I found.

492
00:28:52,402 --> 00:28:57,237
He just spent $120
on a new nightgown for his wife.

493
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,642
I don't think
he's ever gonna leave her.

494
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,549
No one thinks
he's ever gonna leave her.

495
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,238
You're right. You're right.
I know you're right.

496
00:29:21,953 --> 00:29:25,218
Someone is staring at you
in Personal Growth.

497
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,679
I know him.

498
00:29:29,814 --> 00:29:31,790
You'd like him.
He's married.

499
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:33,976
Who is he?

500
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:36,442
Harry Burns.
He's a political consultant.

501
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:38,502
He's cute.

502
00:29:38,823 --> 00:29:41,770
- You think he's cute?
- How do you know he's married?

503
00:29:42,204 --> 00:29:44,245
'Cause last time I saw him
he was getting married.

504
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,294
- When was that?
- Six years ago.

505
00:29:47,705 --> 00:29:50,287
So he might not
be married anymore.

506
00:29:50,835 --> 00:29:52,325
Also, he's obnoxious.

507
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:54,828
Oh, this is just like in the movies, remeber?

508
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,447
in "The Lady Vanishes" when she says to me,
"You're the most obnoxious man..."

509
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:58,500
"The most contemptible."

510
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,376
Then they fall madly in love.

511
00:30:00,503 --> 00:30:03,102
- Also, he never remembers me.
- Sally Albright.

512
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,915
- Hi, Harry.
- I thought it was you.

513
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:10,727
It is. Yeah. This is Marie.

514
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,019
- Was Marie.
- How are you?

515
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,098
- Fine.
- How's Joe?

516
00:30:17,762 --> 00:30:20,526
Fine. I hear he's fine.

517
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,061
You're not with Joe anymore?

518
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,041
We just broke up.

519
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:28,812
I'm sorry.
That's too bad.

520
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,606
Yeah. Well, you know.

521
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,134
Yeah.

522
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:36,626
So, what about you?

523
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:39,214
- I'm fine.
- How's married life?

524
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,209
Not so good.
I'm getting a divorce.

525
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:45,906
Oh, I'm sorry.

526
00:30:46,557 --> 00:30:48,142
I'm really sorry.

527
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:51,177
Yeah. Well, what are you gonna do?

528
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,559
What happened with you guys?

529
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,391
When Joe and I started seeing each
other, we wanted exactly the same thing.

530
00:30:57,925 --> 00:31:00,300
We wanted to live together
but we didn't wanna get married

531
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:03,712
because every time anyone we knew got
married, it ruined their relationship.

532
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,835
They practically never
had sex again.

533
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:07,576
It's true.

534
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:10,095
It's one of the secrets
that no one ever tells you.

535
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:12,828
I would sit around
with my girlfriends who have kids, and...

536
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,930
actually, my one girlfriend
who has kids, Alice.

537
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:19,825
And she would complain about how she and Gary
never did it anymore.

538
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:23,741
She didn't even complain about it now that I think about it.
She just said it matter-of-factly.

539
00:31:23,774 --> 00:31:27,310
She said they were up all night,
they were both exhausted all the time,

540
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:30,628
the kids just took every
sexual impulse they had outta them.

541
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:35,653
Joe and I used to talk about it and we'd say we're so lucky.

542
00:31:35,717 --> 00:31:37,771
We have this wonderful relationship.

543
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:42,174
We can have sex on the kitchen floor
and not worry about the kids walking in.

544
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:45,357
We can fly off to Rome
on a moment's notice.

545
00:31:47,106 --> 00:31:50,325
And then one day I was taking Alice's
little girl for the afternoon,

546
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,274
because I promised
to take her to the circus.

547
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:55,919
And we were in the cab
playing "I Spy."

548
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,828
"I spy a mailbox.
I spy a lamp post."

549
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:03,148
And she looked out the window
and she saw this man and this woman,

550
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:04,178
with these two little kids,

551
00:32:04,227 --> 00:32:07,125
and the man had one of the kids
on his shoulders.

552
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,166
And she said,
"I spy a family."

553
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,100
And I started to cry.

554
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,718
You know, I just started crying.

555
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:19,973
And I went home, and I said...

556
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:24,010
"The thing is, Joe, we never do fly off
to Rome on a moment's notice."

557
00:32:24,344 --> 00:32:25,953
And the kitchen floor?

558
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:27,718
Not once.

559
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:31,449
It's this very cold, hard
Mexican ceramic tile.

560
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:37,035
Anyway, we talked about it
for a long time,

561
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,585
and I said, "This is what I want."

562
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:40,433
And he said, "Well, I don't."

563
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:44,415
And I said, "Well, I guess it's over."
And he left.

564
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:51,011
And the thing is,
I feel really fine.

565
00:32:51,215 --> 00:32:54,412
I am over him.
I mean, I really am over him.

566
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:57,852
That was it for him.
That was the most that he could give.

567
00:32:57,938 --> 00:33:02,375
And every time I think about it, I am
more and more convinced that I did the right thing.

568
00:33:03,004 --> 00:33:04,915
Boy, you sound really healthy.

569
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:06,930
Yeah.

570
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,969
- At least I got the apartment.
- That's what everybody says to me too.

571
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:13,326
But, really, what's so hard
about finding an apartment?

572
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,821
What you do is you read
the obituary column.

573
00:33:16,303 --> 00:33:19,452
You find out who died,
go to the building and then you tip the doorman.

574
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,194
What they could do to make it easier
is combine the obituaries

575
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:23,574
with the real estate section.

576
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:27,195
Say then you have, "Mr. Klein died today,
leaving a wife, two children,

577
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:31,260
and a spacious three-bedroom apartment
with a wood-burning fireplace." See?

578
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,651
You know, the first time we met,
I really didn't like you that much.

579
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,618
- I didn't like you.
- Yeah, you did.

580
00:33:39,688 --> 00:33:42,534
You were just so uptight then.
You're much softer now.

581
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,894
You know, I hate that kind of remark.

582
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,415
It sounds like a compliment,
but really it's an insult.

583
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:49,586
Okay, you're still as hard as nails.

584
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:52,217
I just didn't want to sleep with you,
and you had to write it off

585
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,755
as a character flaw instead of
dealing with the possibility

586
00:33:54,781 --> 00:33:57,356
that it might have something
to do with you.

587
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,982
What's the statute of limitations
on apologies?

588
00:34:03,746 --> 00:34:07,341
- Ten years.
- Ooh, I can just get it in under the wire.

589
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:14,524
Would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

590
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,467
Are we becoming friends now?

591
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:20,661
Well...

592
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,349
yeah.

593
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:27,765
Great. A woman friend.

594
00:34:29,034 --> 00:34:30,715
You know, you may be the first
attractive woman

595
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:33,616
I've not wanted to sleep with
in my entire life.

596
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,869
That's wonderful, Harry.

597
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:40,970
- We were both born in the same hospital.
- In 1921.

598
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:43,624
- Seven days apart.
- In the same hospital.

599
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:46,895
-We both grew up one block away from each other.
- We both lived in tenements.

600
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,744
- On the Lower East Side.
- On Delancey Street.

601
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:53,167
- My family moved to the Bronx when I was ten.
- He lived on Fordham Road.

602
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,355
- Hers moved when she was 11.
- I lived on 183rd Street.

603
00:34:56,423 --> 00:35:01,458
- For 6 years, She worked on the 15th floor, as a nurse,
- I worked for a very prominent neurologist,

604
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:05,484
- where I had a practice on the 14th floor of the very same building.
- Dr. Permelman.

605
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:07,329
- We never met.
- Never met.

606
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,992
Can you imagine that?

607
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:10,448
You know where we met?

608
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,343
- In an elevator
- I was visiting family.

609
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,739
- In the Ambassador Hotel in Chicago.
- He was on the third floor.

610
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,924
I was on the 12th.

611
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:20,605
I rode up nine extra floors
just to keep talking to her.

612
00:35:20,814 --> 00:35:22,805
Nine extra floors.

613
00:35:33,393 --> 00:35:35,881
- Hello.
- You sleeping?

614
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,925
No, I was watching Casablanca.

615
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:38,898
Channel, please.

616
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:39,546
Eleven.

617
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,760
Thank you.
Got it.

618
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:45,939
... that you're telling me you would be happier
with Victor Laszlo than with Humphrey Bogart?

619
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,269
- When did I say that?
- When we drove to New York.

620
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:51,469
I never said that.
I would never have said that.

621
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,774
All right, fine.
Have it your way.

622
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:57,708
- Have you been sleeping?
- Why?

623
00:35:57,859 --> 00:35:59,615
'Cause I haven't been sleeping.

624
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,046
I really miss Helen.

625
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:04,810
Maybe I'm coming down
with something.

626
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:08,526
Last night I was up at 4 in the morning,
watching "Leave It To Beaver" in Spanish.

627
00:36:12,776 --> 00:36:13,831
I'm not well.

628
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:17,836
Well, I went to bed at 7:30 last night.
I haven't done that since the 3rd grade.

629
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,605
Well, that's the good thing
about depression - (you) get your rest.

630
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:21,169
That's the good thing about depression.
You get your rest.

631
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,301
- I'm not depressed.
- Okay, fine.

632
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:27,174
Do you still sleep
on the same side of the bed?

633
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:30,059
I did for a while, but now I'm
pretty much using the whole bed.

634
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,978
God, that's great.

635
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:35,111
I feel weird when
just my leg wanders over.

636
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:37,530
I miss her.

637
00:36:38,249 --> 00:36:41,719
- I don't miss him. I really don't.
- Not even a little?

638
00:36:41,795 --> 00:36:43,763
You know what I miss?

639
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,551
I miss the idea of him.

640
00:36:48,056 --> 00:36:50,937
Maybe I only miss the idea of Helen.

641
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:53,313
No, I miss the whole Helen.

642
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:58,821
Last scene.

643
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:05,542
Goodbye, Rick.
I will miss you.

644
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:07,210
Ooh, Ingrid Bergman.

645
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:09,812
- Now, she's low maintenance.
- Low maintenance?

646
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:13,416
There are two kinds of women,
high maintenance and low maintenance.

647
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,053
And Ingrid Bergman is low maintenance?

648
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:17,892
An LM, definitely.

649
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,225
- Which one am I?
- You're the worst kind.

650
00:37:20,257 --> 00:37:23,028
You're high maintenance,
but you think you're low maintenance.

651
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:25,409
- I don't see that.
- You don't see that?

652
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:28,639
"Waiter, I'll begin with the house salad
but I don't want the regular dressing.

653
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,233
I'll have the Balsamic vinegar and oil
but on the side.

654
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,678
And then the salmon with the mustard sauce,
but I want the sauce on the side."

655
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,618
"On the side" is
a very big thing for you.

656
00:37:36,874 --> 00:37:38,635
Well, I just want it the way I want it.

657
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,513
I know, high maintenance.

658
00:37:44,856 --> 00:37:40,779
- Oh, I just want it the way I want it.
- I know. High maintenance.

659
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:44,119
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

660
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,215
- "Our" expenses?
- Mm hmm.

661
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:50,820
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

662
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:55,779
Best last line of a movie ever.

663
00:37:58,292 --> 00:38:00,502
I'm definitely
coming down with something.

664
00:38:00,573 --> 00:38:03,007
Probably a 24-hour tumor.
They're going around.

665
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,919
- You don't have a tumor.
- How do you know?

666
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,220
If you're so worried,
go see a doctor.

667
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:10,107
No, he'll just tell me it's nothing.

668
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,999
- Will you be able to sleep?
- If not, I'll be okay.

669
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:16,206
- What'll you do?
- I'll stay up and moan.

670
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:18,356
Maybe I should practice now.

671
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:26,189
Good night, Harry.

672
00:38:27,351 --> 00:38:28,875
Good night.

673
00:39:05,104 --> 00:39:09,268
Had my dream again where I'm making love
and the Olympic judges are watching.

674
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:12,106
I'd nailed the compulsories.
So this is it, the finals.

675
00:39:12,178 --> 00:39:15,773
I got a 9.8 from the Canadian,
a perfect 10 from the American...

676
00:39:15,848 --> 00:39:19,375
and my mother, disguised as
an East German judge, gave me a 5.6.

677
00:39:19,452 --> 00:39:21,818
Must have been the dismount.

678
00:39:22,192 --> 00:39:25,221
Basically, it's the same one
I've been having since I was 12.

679
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,158
- What happens?
- No, it's... it's too embarrassing.

680
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,718
- Don't tell me.
- Okay, there's this guy.

681
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:32,822
- What's he look like?
- I don't know.

682
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:36,164
- He's just kind of faceless.
- Faceless guy. Ok. Then what?

683
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:39,965
He rips off my clothes.

684
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,904
Then what happens?

685
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:43,583
That's it.

686
00:39:44,912 --> 00:39:46,010
That's it?

687
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,047
A faceless guy
rips off your clothes,

688
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:50,742
and that's the sex fantasy
you've been having since you were 12?

689
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,250
Exactly the same?

690
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:54,773
Well, sometimes I vary it a little.

691
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,679
- Which part?
- What I'm wearing.

692
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,762
- What?
- Nothing.

693
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:10,646
I have decided
that for the rest of the day,

694
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:13,336
we are going to talk like this.

695
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,839
- Like this?
- No.

696
00:40:14,907 --> 00:40:16,898
Please to repeat after me.

697
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:18,671
- Pepper.
- Pepper.

698
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:25,321
Waiter, there is too much pepper
on my paprikash.

699
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:27,953
Waiter, there is too much pepper

700
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:30,319
on my paprikash.

701
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:33,517
But I would be proud
to partake of your pecan pie.

702
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:35,637
Oh, no!

703
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:37,028
But I would be proud...

704
00:40:37,112 --> 00:40:37,901
But I would be proud

705
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:39,030
to partake

706
00:40:39,098 --> 00:40:42,226
of your pecan pie.

707
00:40:42,301 --> 00:40:43,962
Pecan pie.

708
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,674
Would you like to go
to the movies with me tonight?

709
00:40:51,787 --> 00:40:53,878
Not to repeat.
Please, to answer.

710
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:57,493
Would you like to go to the movies
with me tonight?

711
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,271
Oh, Oh.

712
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,653
Well, I'd love to, Harry,
but I can't.

713
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:05,049
What, do you have a hot date?

714
00:41:05,124 --> 00:41:06,979
Well, yeah. Yeah.

715
00:41:07,053 --> 00:41:08,062
- Really?
- Yeah.

716
00:41:08,164 --> 00:41:12,088
I was gonna tell you about it,
but I don't know, I just, I felt strange about it.

717
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:14,655
- Why?
- Well, because we've been spending so much time together.

718
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:17,114
Oh, I think it's great that you have a date.

719
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,288
- You do?
- Yeah.

720
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:28,565
- Is that what you're gonna wear?
- Yeah.

721
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:32,115
Well, I don't know.
Why?

722
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:36,221
I think you should wear skirts more.
You look really good in skirts.

723
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:38,328
- I do?
- Yeah.

724
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,116
You know, I have a theory
that hieroglyphics

725
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:45,571
are really an ancient comic strip
about a character named Sphinxy.

726
00:41:45,793 --> 00:41:47,765
You know, Harry,
I think you should get out there too.

727
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,597
- Oh, I'm not ready.
- You should.

728
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,230
I would not be good
for anybody right now.

729
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:54,713
It's time.

730
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:58,507
It was the most uncomfortable
night of my life.

731
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:01,141
See, now, it has to go this way.

732
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,694
The first date back
is always the toughest, Harry.

733
00:42:04,797 --> 00:42:06,715
You only had one date.

734
00:42:06,894 --> 00:42:09,072
How do you know
it's not gonna get worse?

735
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:11,461
How much worse can it get
than finishing dinner,

736
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:15,810
having him reach over, pull a hair out
of my head and start flossing with it at the table?

737
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,851
We're talking dream date
compared to my horror.

738
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:22,601
It started out fine.
She's a very nice person.

739
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:26,382
And we're sitting, and we're at this Ethiopian restaurant
that she wanted to go to.

740
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:30,146
And I was making jokes, you know, like "Hey,
I didn't know that they had food in Ethiopia.

741
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,870
This'll be a quick meal. I'll order
two empty plates and we can leave."

742
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:36,310
Yeah. Nothing from her,
not even a smile.

743
00:42:36,366 --> 00:42:39,416
I downshift into small talk,
and I ask her where she went to school.

744
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,256
And she says Michigan State,

745
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:43,197
and this reminds me of Helen.

746
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:46,424
All of a sudden I'm in the middle
of this massive anxiety attack.

747
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,435
My heart's beating like a wild man,
and I start sweating like a pig.

748
00:42:49,597 --> 00:42:50,940
Helen went to Michigan State?

749
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:54,938
No, she went to Northwestern,
but they're both Big Ten schools.

750
00:42:55,102 --> 00:42:57,656
I got so upset,
I had to leave the restaurant.

751
00:43:00,264 --> 00:43:02,562
Harry, I think this takes a long time.

752
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:06,977
It might be months before we're actually able
to enjoy going out with someone new.

753
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:07,959
Yeah.

754
00:43:08,038 --> 00:43:11,537
And maybe longer before we're actually
able to go to bed with someone new.

755
00:43:11,563 --> 00:43:13,483
Oh, I went to bed with her.

756
00:43:15,408 --> 00:43:17,842
- You went to bed with her?
- Sure.

757
00:43:19,149 --> 00:43:19,935
Oh.

758
00:43:24,192 --> 00:43:26,087
I don't understand this relationship.

759
00:43:26,243 --> 00:43:27,106
What do you mean?

760
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:28,933
- You enjoy being with her?
- Yeah.

761
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:31,111
- You find her attractive?
- Yeah.

762
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:33,291
- And you're not sleeping with her?
- No.

763
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:35,712
You're afraid
to let yourself be happy.

764
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:39,275
Why can't you give me credit for this?
This is a big thing for me.

765
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:42,316
I've never had a relationship
with a woman that didn't involve sex.

766
00:43:42,467 --> 00:43:44,824
- (I) feel like I'm growing.
- Are you finished?

767
00:43:45,176 --> 00:43:47,326
Hey, I got a whole stack of quarters
and I was here first.

768
00:43:47,395 --> 00:43:50,060
- Were not!
- Was too!

769
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:52,096
- Big jerk.
- Little creep.

770
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,850
- Where was I?
- You were growing.

771
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:56,602
Yeah.

772
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,497
It's very freeing.

773
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,506
I can say anything to her.

774
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,543
Are you saying you can say things to her
you can't say to me?

775
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:06,691
No, it's just different.
It's a whole different perspective.

776
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:08,968
I get the woman's
point of view on things.

777
00:44:09,218 --> 00:44:12,845
She tells me about the men that she goes out with,
and I can talk to her about the women I see.

778
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,093
- You tell her about other women?
- Yeah.

779
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:18,957
Like the other night, I made love to
this woman, and it was so incredible,

780
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:20,793
I took her to a place
that wasn't human.

781
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:22,274
She actually meowed.

782
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,731
- You made a woman meow?
- Yeah.

783
00:44:24,772 --> 00:44:27,563
That's the point.
I can say these things to her.

784
00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:29,660
And the great thing is,
I don't have to lie

785
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:32,001
because I'm not always thinking
about how to get her into bed.

786
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,630
I can just be myself.

787
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:36,801
You made a woman meow?

788
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:40,455
What do you do with these women?
You just get up out of bed and leave?

789
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:41,032
Sure.

790
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:43,925
Well, explain to me how you do it.
What do you say?

791
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,579
I say I have an early meeting,
early haircut, early squash game.

792
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:49,908
- You don't play squash.
- They don't know that. They just met me.

793
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:53,585
- That's disgusting.
- I know. I feel terrible.

794
00:44:54,003 --> 00:44:56,411
You know, I'm so glad
I never got involved with you.

795
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,184
I just would have ended up
being some woman

796
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,121
you had to get up out of bed and leave
at 3:00 a.m. and go clean your andirons.

797
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,302
And you don't even have a fireplace.
Not that I would know this.

798
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,759
Why are you getting so upset?
This is not about you.

799
00:45:07,878 --> 00:45:08,952
Yes, it is.

800
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:12,051
You are a human affront to all women,
and I am a woman.

801
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:15,080
Hey, I don't feel great about this,
but I don't hear anyone complaining.

802
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:17,640
Of course not.
You're out the door too fast.

803
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:20,057
I think they have an okay time.

804
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,705
How do you know?

805
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:23,874
What d'ya mean how do I know? I know.

806
00:45:24,448 --> 00:45:25,915
Because they...

807
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,484
Yes, because they...

808
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:31,063
How do you know
that they're really...

809
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:34,207
What are you saying?
That they fake orgasm?

810
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,918
- It's possible.
- Get outta here.

811
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:40,245
Why? Most women, at one time
or another, have faked it.

812
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:43,572
- Well, They haven't faked it with me.
- How do you know?

813
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,372
Because I know.

814
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:48,720
Oh.

815
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,111
Right. That's right.

816
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:53,585
I forgot.
You're a man.

817
00:45:53,654 --> 00:45:55,735
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

818
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,875
It's just that all men are sure it never happened to them,
and most women at one time or another have done it.

819
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:01,126
So you do the math.

820
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:04,130
You don't think
that I can tell the difference?

821
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:05,539
No.

822
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,624
Get outta here.

823
00:46:13,797 --> 00:46:15,202
Ooh.

824
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:18,063
Oh.

825
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:20,805
Ooh.

826
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,594
Are you okay?

827
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,730
Oh~

828
00:46:27,721 --> 00:46:29,712
Oh, God.

829
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:32,857
Ooh~
Oh, God!

830
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:34,513
Ohh~

831
00:46:35,642 --> 00:46:37,031
Ah~

832
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,321
Ohhh~

833
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,815
Oh, God~

834
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,251
Oh, yeah, right there.

835
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:45,233
Oh~

836
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,138
Ohh~

837
00:46:48,243 --> 00:46:49,536
Ahh~

838
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:50,833
Ohh~

839
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:52,337
Oh, God~

840
00:46:52,523 --> 00:46:53,311
Ohh~

841
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:54,342
Yes!

842
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,377
Yes!

843
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:56,430
Yes!

844
00:46:59,265 --> 00:47:00,114
Ah~

845
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:01,163
Aoh!

846
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:02,831
Aoh, yes!

847
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,074
Oh, God!

848
00:47:17,745 --> 00:47:19,150
Ohh!

849
00:47:27,419 --> 00:47:29,512
I'll have what she's having.

And days of auld lang syne

898
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:30,130
Well, he was the head counselor
at the boys' camp,

899
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:32,925
and I was the head counselor
at the girls' camp.

900
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:36,859
And they had a social one night,
and he walked across the room.

901
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:40,095
I thought he was coming
to talk to my friend Maxine,

902
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:43,877
'cause people were always
crossing rooms to talk to Maxine.

903
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:47,009
But he was coming to talk to me,
and he said,

904
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:50,071
"I'm Ben Small
of the Coney Island Smalls."

905
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:51,784
At that moment, I knew.

906
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,781
I knew the way you know
about a good melon.

907
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,274
You sent flowers to yourself?

908
00:50:59,697 --> 00:51:02,881
Sixty dollars I spent on this big,
stupid arrangement of flowers

909
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:05,043
and I wrote a card that I planned
to leave on the front table

910
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:07,394
where Arthur would just
happen to see it.

911
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:09,606
What did the card say?

912
00:51:09,968 --> 00:51:12,577
"Please say yes.
Love, Jonathan."

913
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,127
- Did it work?
- He never even came over.

914
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:17,971
He forgot this charity thing
that his wife is the chairman of.

915
00:51:17,997 --> 00:51:20,238
- He's never gonna leave her!
- Of course he isn't.

916
00:51:20,264 --> 00:51:23,810
You're right. I know you're right.
Where is this place?

917
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:25,660
Somewhere in the next block.

918
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:28,383
Uh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

919
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:32,150
Look, Harry is one of my best friends,
and you are one of my best friends.

920
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:35,291
If by some chance you two hit it off,
then we can all still be friends,

921
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,993
instead of drifting apart

922
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,537
(like) the way you do when you get involved with
someone who doesn't know your friends.

923
00:51:39,619 --> 00:51:42,666
You and I haven't drifted apart
since I started seeing Arthur.

924
00:51:44,002 --> 00:51:47,772
If Arthur ever left his wife
and I actually met him,

925
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:51,045
I am sure that you and I
would drift apart.

926
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:53,336
He's never gonna leave her.

927
00:51:53,617 --> 00:51:55,575
Of course he isn't.

928
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:58,011
You're right. You're right.
I know you're right.

929
00:51:58,483 --> 00:52:00,608
- I don't know about this.
- It's just a dinner.

930
00:52:00,686 --> 00:52:02,631
You know, I've finally got to
a little place in my life.

931
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:05,789
where I'm comfortable with the fact
that it's just me and my work.

932
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:07,751
(If) she's so great,
why aren't you taking her out?

933
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:10,134
How many times do I have to tell you?
We're just friends.

934
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,126
- So you're saying she's not that attractive?
- No, I told you she is attractive.

935
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:14,995
Yeah, but you also said
she had a good personality.

936
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:17,134
She has a good personality.

937
00:52:19,405 --> 00:52:20,621
What?

938
00:52:20,906 --> 00:52:22,640
When someone's
not that attractive,

939
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:25,416
they're always described
as having a good personality.

940
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,383
Look, if you would asked me,
"What does she look like?"

941
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:30,810
 and I said, "She has a good personality,"
that means she's not attractive.

942
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,646
But just because I happened to mention
that she has a good personality,

943
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:34,819
she could be either.

944
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,512
She could be attractive
with a good personality,

945
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:38,453
or not attractive
with a good personality.

946
00:52:38,524 --> 00:52:40,515
- So which one is she?
- Attractive.

947
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,764
But not beautiful, right?

948
00:52:45,686 --> 00:52:47,763
It's like whenever
I read Jimmy Breslin,

949
00:52:47,975 --> 00:52:51,174
it's as if he's leaving
some kind of a wake-up call

950
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,300
for the City of New York, you know.

951
00:52:53,372 --> 00:52:55,495
I'm sorry. What do you mean
by a wake-up call?

952
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:58,175
Oh, he's saying we've actually
got people in the city...

953
00:53:00,068 --> 00:53:00,790
An art director.

954
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:02,868
Would I have seen any of your windows?

955
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:07,244
Did you see this Barney's stand a couple of weeks ago.
I did a thing with hostages.

956
00:53:07,591 --> 00:53:09,412
- Uh, The people in blindfolds.
- Yeah.

957
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:11,922
- It's...
- I thought it was like late '80s.

958
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,026
Uh huh.

959
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:15,249
- It's macho. I don't think...
- That's interesting.

960
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:18,542
Uh, Let's just say I'm really just not
a big fan of Jimmy Breslin.

961
00:53:18,582 --> 00:53:22,259
Well, He's the reason I became a writer,
but that's not important.

962
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:39,547
Harry, you and Marie
are both from New Jersey.

963
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:41,210
- Really?
- Where are you from?

964
00:53:41,286 --> 00:53:42,878
- South Orange.
- Haddenfield.

965
00:53:42,947 --> 00:53:44,280
Oh~

966
00:53:50,913 --> 00:53:52,427
So, what are we gonna order?

967
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:55,159
Well, I'm gonna start
with the grilled radicchio.

968
00:53:55,281 --> 00:53:56,749
Jess, Sally is a great orderer.

969
00:53:56,835 --> 00:53:58,803
Not only does she always pick
the best thing on the menu,

970
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:01,964
but she orders it in a way that even the
chef didn't know how good it could be.

971
00:54:02,344 --> 00:54:04,311
I think Restaurants have
become too important.

972
00:54:04,378 --> 00:54:05,508
Oh, I agree.

973
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:09,776
"Restaurants are to people in the '80s
what theater was to people in the '60s."

974
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:11,782
I read that in a magazine.

975
00:54:12,713 --> 00:54:14,512
I wrote that.

976
00:54:14,886 --> 00:54:17,717
- Get outta here.
- No, I did. I wrote that.

977
00:54:17,802 --> 00:54:20,442
I've never quoted anything
from a magazine in my life.

978
00:54:20,468 --> 00:54:21,244
That's amazing.

979
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,851
Don't you think that's amazing?
And you wrote it?

980
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:27,424
I also wrote,
"Pesto is the quiche of the '80s."

981
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:30,263
- Get over yourself!
- I did!

982
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,952
- Where did I read that?
- New York magazine.

983
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:34,871
Sally writes for New York magazine.

984
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,966
You know, that piece had a real impact on me.
I don't know that much about writing, but...

985
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,335
Well, it spoke to you,
and that pleases me.

986
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,227
I mean, I really, you have to admire people
who can be that articulate...

987
00:54:46,277 --> 00:54:50,511
Nobody has ever quoted me
back to me before.

988
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,610
Oh, I've been looking
for a red suede pump.

989
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:07,108
What do you think of Jess?

990
00:55:08,468 --> 00:55:11,460
- Well, ur...
- Do you think you could go out with him?

991
00:55:12,704 --> 00:55:16,279
- I don't know.
- 'Cause I feel really comfortable with him.

992
00:55:16,624 --> 00:55:20,006
- You wanna go out with Jess.
- If it would be all right with you.

993
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,500
Sure, sure.

994
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:24,447
I'm just worried about Harry.
He's very sensitive.

995
00:55:24,473 --> 00:55:28,422
He's going through a rough period.
I just don't want you to reject him right now.

996
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,653
- I wouldn't. I totally understand.
- Ok.

997
00:55:30,969 --> 00:55:34,146
If you don't think you're gonna call
Marie, do you mind if I call her?

998
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:36,061
- No.
- Good, good, good.

999
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:40,230
But for tonight you shouldn't.
I mean, Sally's very vulnerable right now.

1000
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:43,352
Well, you can call Marie, it's fine,
but just like wait a week or so, you know?

1001
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,572
- Don't make any moves tonight.
- Fine. No problem.

1002
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:47,635
I wasn't even thinking
about tonight.

1003
00:55:48,947 --> 00:55:52,542
Well, I don't really feel much like walking anymore.
I think I'll get a cab.

1004
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:54,056
- I'll go with you.
- Great!

1005
00:55:54,096 --> 00:55:55,709
Taxi!

1006
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:09,761
A man came to me and said,

1007
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,997
"I found nice girl for you.

1008
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:17,337
She lives in the next village...

1009
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:20,638
and she is ready for marriage."

1010
00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:25,836
We were not supposed to meet
until the wedding,

1011
00:56:26,284 --> 00:56:28,214
but I wanted to make sure.

1012
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,886
So I sneak into her village,

1013
00:56:31,027 --> 00:56:32,833
hid behind a tree,

1014
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:35,887
watch her washing the clothes.

1015
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,421
I think if I don't like
the way she looks,

1016
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,193
I don't marry her.

1017
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:45,253
But she looked really nice to me.

1018
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:48,544
So I said, "Okay," to the man.

1019
00:56:49,274 --> 00:56:50,969
We get married.

1020
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:54,651
We're married for 55 years.

1021
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:04,923
- I have to get this.
- Harry, we're here for Jess and Marie.

1022
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:07,527
I know. We'll find them something.
There's great stuff here.

1023
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,300
- We should've gone to the plant store.
- Here, perfect for them.

1024
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:11,653
What's that?

1025
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:14,901
Battery-operated pith helmet,
with fan.

1026
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,442
Why is this necessary in life?

1027
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:21,003
I don't know. Look, look at this.
(It) also makes great fries.

1028
00:57:21,184 --> 00:57:25,333
Oh, uh-oh. Good. Call off the dogs.
The hunt is over.

1029
00:57:25,428 --> 00:57:27,897
Sally,
this is the greatest.

1030
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:30,709
Sally, please report to me.

1031
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:33,418
Look at this. This is the greatest.
You're gonna love this.

1032
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,251
This is
a singing machine.

1033
00:57:35,307 --> 00:57:39,266
Look, you sing the lead,
and this has the backup and everything.

1034
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,279
This is from Oklahoma.
Here's the lyrics right here.

1035
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:43,745
- "Surrey With the Fringe on Top."
- Yes. Perfect.

1036
00:57:44,103 --> 00:57:45,087
Ooh!

1037
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,708
Chicks and ducks and geese
better scurry

1038
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,749
When I take you out
in my surrey

1039
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:55,337
When I take you out in my surrey

1040
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:58,290
With the fringe on top
Now you.

1041
00:57:58,367 --> 00:58:01,182
Watch that fringe
and see how it flutters

1042
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:03,971
When I drive them
high-steppin'strutters

1043
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,599
Nosy pokes will peek
through the shutters

1044
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:08,895
And their eyes will pop

1045
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,957
The wheels are yellow
the upholstery's brown

1046
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:14,288
The dashboard's
genuine leather

1047
00:58:14,448 --> 00:58:17,369
With isinglass curtains
that will roll...

1048
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:18,805
What?

1049
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:22,667
It's my voice, isn't it?
You hate my voice.

1050
00:58:22,762 --> 00:58:25,612
- I know. It's terrible. Joe hated it.
- It's Helen.

1051
00:58:26,282 --> 00:58:27,779
Helen?

1052
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:30,265
She's coming right towards me.

1053
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:40,207
How are you, Harry?

1054
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,772
Fine. I'm fine.

1055
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:46,896
This is Ira Stone.
Harry Burns.

1056
00:58:53,132 --> 00:58:54,803
I'm sorry.
This is Sally Albright.

1057
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:58,203
Helen Hillson and Ira.

1058
00:59:00,384 --> 00:59:02,784
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1059
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:06,791
Well...

1060
00:59:08,475 --> 00:59:09,455
see you.

1061
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:11,386
Yeah. Bye.

1062
00:59:13,196 --> 00:59:15,687
Nice to meet you, Ira.

1063
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,981
You okay?

1064
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,879
Yeah, I'm perfect.

1065
00:59:26,707 --> 00:59:29,053
She looked weird, didn't she?
She looked really weird.

1066
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,274
- She looked very weird.
- I've never seen her before.

1067
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:33,816
Trust me. She looked weird.
Her legs looked heavy.

1068
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:35,940
- Really. She must be retaining water.
- Harry!

1069
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,386
Believe me,
the woman saved everything.

1070
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,517
You sure you're okay?

1071
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,193
Oh, I'm fine. Look, it had
to happen at some point.

1072
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:49,826
In a city of eight million people,
you're bound to run into your ex-wife.

1073
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,291
So, boom, it happened.
And now I'm fine.

1074
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:59,413
I like it. It works.
It says home to me.

1075
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:02,556
All right. We'll let
Harry and Sally be the judge.

1076
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:05,324
What do you think?

1077
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:08,257
- It's nice.
- Case closed.

1078
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,719
Of course he likes it.
He's a guy.

1079
01:00:11,062 --> 01:00:11,920
Sally?

1080
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,191
What's so awful about it?

1081
01:00:16,295 --> 01:00:20,594
It's so awful, there's no way to even begin
to explain what's so awful about it.

1082
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,984
Honey, I don't object
to any of your things.

1083
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:25,401
If we had an extra room,
you could put all your things in it,

1084
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:30,292
- including your bar stools...
- Honey, wait, wait, honey. You don't like my bar stools?

1085
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,962
Harry, come on.
Someone has to be on my side.

1086
01:00:34,033 --> 01:00:37,103
I'm on your side. I'm just
trynna help you have a good taste.

1087
01:00:37,129 --> 01:00:39,354
I have good taste!

1088
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:42,309
Everybody thinks they have
good taste and a sense of humor,

1089
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:44,826
but they couldn't possibly
all have good taste.

1090
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:48,589
You know, it's funny.
We started out like this, Helen and I.

1091
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:52,150
We had blank walls. We hung things.
We picked out tiles together.

1092
01:00:52,244 --> 01:00:55,236
Then you know what happens? Six years
later, you find yourself singing

1093
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:58,507
"Surrey With a Fringe on Top"
in front of Ira!

1094
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,869
Do we have to talk
about this right now?

1095
01:01:00,937 --> 01:01:03,963
Yes, I think right now actually is
the perfect time to talk about this

1096
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:07,786
because I want our friends to benefit
from the wisdom of my experience.

1097
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,595
Right now everything is great.
Everyone is happy. Everyone is in love.

1098
01:01:11,674 --> 01:01:15,022
And that's wonderful. But you
gotta know that sooner or later,

1099
01:01:15,054 --> 01:01:18,149
you're gonna be screaming at each other
about who's gonna get this dish.

1100
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:21,418
This eight-dollar dish will cost you
a thousand dollars in phone calls

1101
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:23,452
to the legal firm of "That's Mine, This is Yours."

1102
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:24,034
Harry.

1103
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:24,987
Please.

1104
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:26,747
Jess, Marie.

1105
01:01:27,192 --> 01:01:28,998
Do me a favor
for your own good.

1106
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,281
Put your name
in your books right now,

1107
01:01:31,448 --> 01:01:33,397
before they get mixed up
and you don't know whose is whose.

1108
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:35,335
Because someday,
believe it or not,

1109
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:38,499
you'll go 15 rounds over who's
gonna get this coffee table.

1110
01:01:38,773 --> 01:01:41,169
This stupid, wagon wheel,

1111
01:01:41,195 --> 01:01:44,111
Roy Rogers, garage sale
coffee table!

1112
01:01:45,975 --> 01:01:47,478
I thought you liked it.

1113
01:01:47,655 --> 01:01:49,937
I was being nice!

1114
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:56,720
He just bumped into Helen.

1115
01:02:03,683 --> 01:02:06,592
I want you to know

1116
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:10,845
that I will never want
that wagon wheel coffee table.

1117
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:22,226
I know. I know.
I shouldn't have done that.

1118
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:26,870
Harry, you're gonna have to try and find
a way of not expressing every feeling

1119
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:29,721
that you have
every moment that you have them.

1120
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,441
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1121
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:35,510
There are times and places
for things.

1122
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:39,731
Well, the next time you're giving a lecture series
on social graces, Would you let me know

1123
01:02:39,803 --> 01:02:41,236
'cause I'll sign up.

1124
01:02:41,304 --> 01:02:45,001
Hey! You don't have to take
your anger out on me.

1125
01:02:45,114 --> 01:02:47,344
Oh, I think I'm entitled to throw
a little anger your way,

1126
01:02:47,377 --> 01:02:51,245
especially when I'm being told how to
live my life by Miss Hospital Corners.

1127
01:02:51,694 --> 01:02:55,148
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I mean nothing bothers you.

1128
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,278
You never get upset
about anything!

1129
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,840
Don't be ridiculous.

1130
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:02,081
What? You never get upset
about Joe.

1131
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:04,994
I never see that back up on you.
How is that possible?

1132
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,386
Don't you experience
any feelings of loss?

1133
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:09,593
I don't have
to take this crap from you.

1134
01:03:09,626 --> 01:03:11,931
If you're so over Joe,
why aren't you seeing anyone?

1135
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:13,894
- I see people!
- See people.

1136
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:16,664
Have you slept with one person
since you broke up with Joe?

1137
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:19,585
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

1138
01:03:19,672 --> 01:03:23,467
That will prove I'm over Joe
because I fuck somebody?

1139
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:25,666
You're gonna have to move back
to New Jersey,

1140
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:27,506
because you slept
with everybody in New York,

1141
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:30,781
and I don't see that turning Helen
into a faint memory for you.

1142
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:34,591
Besides, I will make love to somebody
when it is making love,

1143
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:38,057
not the way you do it, like you're
out for revenge or something.

1144
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,644
Are you finished now?

1145
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,004
Yes.

1146
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:45,413
Can I say something?

1147
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,372
Yes.

1148
01:03:50,373 --> 01:03:52,898
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1149
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,154
Don't say a word.

1150
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:13,228
It's a monkey.
Monkey see, monkey do.

1151
01:04:13,296 --> 01:04:16,080
- It's an ape. Going ape.
- It's a baby!

1152
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:19,230
- Planet of the Apes.
- She just said it's a baby.

1153
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,725
- How 'bout planet of the dopes?
- It doesn't look like a baby.

1154
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:24,297
Bigmouth baby.
Mick Jagger as a baby!

1155
01:04:24,337 --> 01:04:27,073
- Baby ape! Baby ape!
- Stop with the apes, would you please?

1156
01:04:27,143 --> 01:04:30,306
- Baby's breath!
- Rosemary's Baby's mouth.

1157
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,905
- Won't you come home, Bill Baby?
- Kiss the baby.

1158
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:37,578
- Melancholy Baby's mouth.
- Baby fish mouth! Baby fish mouth!

1159
01:04:38,321 --> 01:04:41,051
- Fifteen seconds.
- Baby Boom!

1160
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:44,870
- Baby...
- Draw something resembling anything.

1161
01:04:44,921 --> 01:04:49,024
- Baby... Ur, crying baby. Kiss the baby.
- Baby spitting up. Exorcist baby!

1162
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,130
- Yes, sir, that's my baby!
- No, sir, don't mean maybe.

1163
01:04:53,203 --> 01:04:54,659
That's it. Time's up.

1164
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:55,923
Baby talk.

1165
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:57,586
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

1166
01:04:57,586 --> 01:04:59,611
Baby talk? What's that?
That's not a saying.

1167
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:02,954
Oh, but "baby fish mouth" is sweeping
the nation. I hear them talking.

1168
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:08,402
Final score. Our team, 110.
You guys, 60.

1169
01:05:11,468 --> 01:05:12,341
Well.

1170
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:13,227
I can't draw.

1171
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:17,071
No. That's a baby,
and it's clearly talking.

1172
01:05:17,388 --> 01:05:19,073
You're wonderful.

1173
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:21,075
All right, who wants coffee?

1174
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,015
- I do, and I love you.
- Do you have any tea?

1175
01:05:23,174 --> 01:05:25,013
- One tea.
- Industrial strength.

1176
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:28,745
- I'll help you. Decaf?
- Yeah.

1177
01:05:29,506 --> 01:05:30,906
- Three.
- Yes, please.

1178
01:05:31,005 --> 01:05:31,558
Cream?

1179
01:05:31,584 --> 01:05:34,280
- Where's the bathroom?
- Through that door, down the hall.

1180
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:43,532
Never looked like
a baby to me.

1181
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,147
- Which part?
- All of it.

1182
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:47,117
Hey, Jess. You were gonna show me
the cover off your book.

1183
01:05:47,174 --> 01:05:48,711
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's in the den.

1184
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:52,835
Look, Good. Julian, help yourself.
Have more wine, whatever you like, Ok?

1185
01:05:53,275 --> 01:05:55,705
I like saying, "It's in the den."
It's got a nice ring to it.

1186
01:05:55,978 --> 01:05:58,917
Emily is a little young for Harry,
don't you think?

1187
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,746
Well, she's young,
but look what she's done.

1188
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:04,409
What has she done?
She makes desserts.

1189
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:06,420
Does Julian seem
a little stuffy to you?

1190
01:06:06,488 --> 01:06:08,956
He's a good guy.
You should talk to him, get to know him.

1191
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:10,423
He's too tall to talk to.

1192
01:06:10,492 --> 01:06:13,689
She makes 3,500
chocolate mousse pies a week.

1193
01:06:15,154 --> 01:06:17,171
Emily is "Aunt Emily"?

1194
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:19,891
He took us all to a Met game last week.
It was great.

1195
01:06:19,969 --> 01:06:24,497
- You all went to a Met game together?
- Yeah, but, it was a last-minute thing.

1196
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:26,040
But Sally hates baseball.

1197
01:06:26,108 --> 01:06:30,741
- Harry doesn't even like sweets.
- Julian is great.

1198
01:06:31,226 --> 01:06:33,205
I know.
He's a grown-up.

1199
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:35,409
- Emily is terrific.
- Yeah.

1200
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,918
Of course when I asked her
where she was when Kennedy was shot,

1201
01:06:37,987 --> 01:06:39,767
she said,
"Ted Kennedy was shot?"

1202
01:06:52,568 --> 01:06:54,627
- Hello.
- Are you alone?

1203
01:06:54,737 --> 01:06:58,298
- Yeah, I was just finishing a book.
- Could you come over?

1204
01:06:58,645 --> 01:07:01,605
- What's the matter?
- He's getting married.

1205
01:07:01,937 --> 01:07:02,852
Who?

1206
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:05,103
Joe.

1207
01:07:05,678 --> 01:07:07,612
I'll be right there.

1208
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:12,460
Hi.

1209
01:07:13,202 --> 01:07:15,067
Are you all right?

1210
01:07:16,992 --> 01:07:18,926
Come on in.

1211
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:24,803
- I'm sorry to call you so late.
- It's all right.

1212
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:28,686
- I need a Kleenex.
- Okay.

1213
01:07:30,878 --> 01:07:33,572
He just called me up,
"wanted to see how you were."

1214
01:07:33,699 --> 01:07:36,176
"Fine. How are you?"
"Fine."

1215
01:07:36,245 --> 01:07:40,045
His secretary is on vacation,
everything's all backed up,

1216
01:07:40,115 --> 01:07:44,286
he's got a big case in Newark,
blah, blah, blah.

1217
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:47,201
And I'm sitting
on the phone thinking

1218
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:49,399
"I'm over him.
I really am over him.

1219
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:53,020
I can't believe I was ever remotely
interested in any of this."

1220
01:07:54,496 --> 01:07:57,897
And then he said,
"I have some news."

1221
01:08:01,671 --> 01:08:05,903
She works in his office.
She's a paralegal. Her name is Kimberly.

1222
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:09,729
He just met her.

1223
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:12,780
She's supposed to be
his transitional person.

1224
01:08:12,848 --> 01:08:15,510
She's not supposed
to be the one.

1225
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:25,723
All this time, I've been saying
that he didn't wanna get married.

1226
01:08:27,272 --> 01:08:32,098
But the truth is,
he didn't wanna marry me.

1227
01:08:35,427 --> 01:08:37,361
He didn't love me.

1228
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,201
If you could take him back right now,
would you?

1229
01:08:46,081 --> 01:08:47,740
No!

1230
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:51,311
But why didn't
he wanna marry me?

1231
01:08:51,854 --> 01:08:54,561
- What's the matter with me?
- Nothing.

1232
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:57,034
- I'm difficult.
- You're challenging.

1233
01:08:57,169 --> 01:09:00,118
I'm too structured.
I'm completely closed off.

1234
01:09:00,203 --> 01:09:01,612
But in a good way.

1235
01:09:02,093 --> 01:09:05,529
No. No, I drove him away.

1236
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,943
And I'm gonna be 40.

1237
01:09:11,006 --> 01:09:12,099
When?

1238
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:15,141
- Someday.
- In eight years.

1239
01:09:15,497 --> 01:09:17,051
But it's there.

1240
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:21,079
It's just sitting there
like this big dead end.

1241
01:09:21,701 --> 01:09:23,913
And it's not the same for men.

1242
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:27,371
Charlie Chaplin had babies
when he was 73.

1243
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:29,697
Yeah, but he was too old
to pick 'em up.

1244
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,962
Oh, come here.
Come here.

1245
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:40,001
It's gonna be okay.

1246
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:42,226
It's gonna be fine.
You'll see.

1247
01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:46,071
Oh, go ahead. It's not one
of my favorites anyway.

1248
01:09:48,744 --> 01:09:51,367
It's gonna be okay. Hmm?

1249
01:09:57,253 --> 01:09:58,817
Hmm?
Ok?

1250
01:09:59,213 --> 01:10:00,176
You're Ok.

1251
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:01,917
Hmm.

1252
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:05,162
I'll make some tea.

1253
01:10:05,217 --> 01:10:08,278
Harry. Could you just hold me
a little longer?

1254
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:10,098
Oh, sure.

1255
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,324
Uh.

1256
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,058
Are you comfortable?

1257
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:53,557
Sure.

1258
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:01,444
Do you want something
to drink or something?

1259
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:03,184
No, I'm okay.

1260
01:11:04,408 --> 01:11:08,078
Well, I'm gonna get up for some water,
so it's really no trouble.

1261
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:10,367
Okay, water.

1262
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:09,339
You have all your videotapes
alphabetized and on index cards?

1263
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,813
- Thank you.
- Do you wanna watch something?

1264
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:18,601
- No, not unless you do.
- No. That's okay.

1265
01:12:32,663 --> 01:12:34,806
Do you wanna go to sleep?

1266
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,516
Okay.

1267
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:12,201
Where are you going?

1268
01:13:13,096 --> 01:13:14,842
I gotta go.

1269
01:13:16,594 --> 01:13:19,888
Gotta go home, I gotta change my clothes,
then I have to go to work. And so do you.

1270
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:22,207
But after work I'd like to take you
out to dinner if you're free.

1271
01:13:22,381 --> 01:13:24,834
- Are you free?
- Yes.

1272
01:13:25,044 --> 01:13:26,375
Fine. I'll call you later.

1273
01:13:27,046 --> 01:13:29,973
- Fine.
- Fine.

1274
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:49,527
Yours.

1275
01:13:50,227 --> 01:13:52,161
- Hello.
- I'm sorry to call so early.

1276
01:13:52,284 --> 01:13:54,377
- Are you all right?
- No one I know would call at this hour.

1277
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:56,667
- I did something terrible.
- What did you do?

1278
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,708
- No one I know would call at this hour.
- It's so awful.

1279
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:00,096
- I need to talk.
- What happened?

1280
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,743
- What's the matter?
- Harry came over last night.

1281
01:14:01,795 --> 01:14:04,648
- I went to Sally's last night.
- Because I was upset Joe was getting married.

1282
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:06,840
- And one thing led to another.
- Before I knew it we were kissing.

1283
01:14:06,904 --> 01:14:09,085
- To make a long story short, we did it.
- We did it.

1284
01:14:09,334 --> 01:14:11,712
- They did it.
- That's great, Sally.

1285
01:14:11,788 --> 01:14:14,140
- We've been praying for you.
- You should've done it in the first place.

1286
01:14:14,212 --> 01:14:16,587
- For months, we've been saying you should do it.
- You guys belong together.

1287
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:20,085
- It's like killing two birds with one stone.
- It's like two wrongs make a right.

1288
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:21,824
- How was it?
- The during part was good.

1289
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:23,490
- I thought it was good.
- But then I felt suffocated.

1290
01:14:23,516 --> 01:14:25,945
- But then I guess it wasn't.
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- The worst.

1291
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:27,526
- I had to get out of there.
- He just disappeared.

1292
01:14:27,556 --> 01:14:29,410
- I feel so bad.
- I'm so embarrassed.

1293
01:14:29,436 --> 01:14:30,738
- I don't blame you.
- That's horrible.

1294
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:32,837
- I think I'm coming down with something.
- I'm catching a cold.

1295
01:14:32,911 --> 01:14:35,071
Look, it would've been great if it worked out,
but it didn't.

1296
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,478
You should never go to bed
with anyone

1297
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:38,462
when you've found out
your last boyfriend is getting married.

1298
01:14:38,526 --> 01:14:39,692
- Who's that talking?
- Who?

1299
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:41,844
- Is that Jess on the phone?
- It's Jane Fonda on the VCR.

1300
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:44,580
- It's Bryant Gumbel.
- You wanna come over for breakfast?

1301
01:14:44,683 --> 01:14:47,088
- No, I'm not up to it.
- No, I feel too awful.

1302
01:14:47,157 --> 01:14:50,388
- Good. I mean it's so early.
- But call me later if you want.

1303
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,428
- I'll call you later, okay?
- Okay, bye.

1304
01:14:52,473 --> 01:14:54,224
- Bye.
- Bye.

1305
01:14:56,342 --> 01:14:59,038
- God!
- I know.

1306
01:15:00,136 --> 01:15:03,299
Tell me I'll never have
to be out there again.

1307
01:15:06,539 --> 01:15:08,973
You will never have
to be out there again.

1308
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:15,129
I'll just say
we made a mistake.

1309
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:19,300
Sally, it was a mistake.

1310
01:15:21,038 --> 01:15:23,632
I just hope
I get to say it first.

1311
01:15:24,427 --> 01:15:27,089
I hope she says it
before I do.

1312
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,323
It was a mistake.

1313
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,835
I am so relieved
that you think so too.

1314
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,697
I'm not saying
last night wasn't great.

1315
01:15:38,463 --> 01:15:41,523
- It was.
- Yes, it was.

1316
01:15:42,574 --> 01:15:46,004
- We just never should have done it.
- I couldn't agree more.

1317
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:49,760
- I'm so relieved.
- Great.

1318
01:15:49,824 --> 01:15:50,700
Yeah.

1319
01:15:54,093 --> 01:15:56,027
Two mixed green salads.

1320
01:16:25,696 --> 01:16:30,531
It is so nice when you can sit with
someone and not have to talk. Hmm?

1321
01:16:34,538 --> 01:16:37,176
It's just like, most of the time
you go to bed with someone,

1322
01:16:37,251 --> 01:16:41,209
then she tells you all her stories,
you tell her your stories.

1323
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:45,098
With Sally and me, we'd already
heard each other's stories.

1324
01:16:45,358 --> 01:16:49,133
So once we went to bed, we didn't know
what we were supposed to do. You know?

1325
01:16:49,212 --> 01:16:51,458
Sure, Harry.

1326
01:16:52,373 --> 01:16:53,840
I don't know.

1327
01:16:54,098 --> 01:16:55,865
Maybe you get to a certain point
in a relationship

1328
01:16:55,913 --> 01:16:58,019
where it's just too late
to have sex.

1329
01:16:58,087 --> 01:16:59,303
You know?

1330
01:17:09,532 --> 01:17:11,709
Is Harry bringing anyone
to the wedding?

1331
01:17:12,035 --> 01:17:13,900
I don't think so.

1332
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,905
Is he seeing anyone?

1333
01:17:17,175 --> 01:17:21,000
He was seeing
this anthropologist, but...

1334
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:26,034
- What did she look like?
- Thin. Pretty. Big tits.

1335
01:17:26,228 --> 01:17:27,718
Your basic nightmare.

1336
01:17:32,466 --> 01:17:33,899
What do you think?

1337
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:38,087
Oh, Marie.

1338
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,562
You tell the truth.

1339
01:17:41,982 --> 01:17:44,075
It's just beautiful.

1340
01:18:16,065 --> 01:18:17,774
We are gathered here today

1341
01:18:17,815 --> 01:18:22,058
to celebrate the marriage
of Marie and Jess

1342
01:18:22,635 --> 01:18:25,658
and to consecrate
their vows of matrimony.

1343
01:18:26,009 --> 01:18:29,385
The vows they will take
join their lives.

1344
01:18:29,612 --> 01:18:34,502
The wine they will share
binds all their hopes together.

1345
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:39,092
And by the rings they will wear,
they will be known to all

1346
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:42,145
as husband and wife.

1347
01:18:52,568 --> 01:18:56,504
I've never seen her so happy.
She's a totally different person.

1348
01:18:56,579 --> 01:19:01,278
Oh, yeah, she is, girl. It's great,
but what are we gonna do about you?

1349
01:19:01,344 --> 01:19:03,676
- Me?
- Honey, you wanna dance?

1350
01:19:03,746 --> 01:19:05,451
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

1351
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,014
Excuse us.

1352
01:19:09,765 --> 01:19:10,623
Hi.

1353
01:19:10,817 --> 01:19:11,881
Hello.

1354
01:19:16,095 --> 01:19:18,791
- Nice ceremony.
- Beautiful.

1355
01:19:21,794 --> 01:19:24,021
Boy, the holidays are rough.
Every year I just try to

1356
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:27,009
get from the day before Thanksgiving
to the day after New Year's.

1357
01:19:27,074 --> 01:19:29,042
A lot of suicides.

1358
01:19:30,673 --> 01:19:32,531
Would you like
a pea pod with a shrimp?

1359
01:19:32,578 --> 01:19:33,938
Thank you.

1360
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:36,973
- How've you been?
- Fine.

1361
01:19:38,078 --> 01:19:39,160
Are you seeing anybody?

1362
01:19:39,385 --> 01:19:40,385
- Harry.
- What?

1363
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:42,289
- I don't want to talk about this.
- Why not?

1364
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,255
I don't want
to talk about it.

1365
01:19:45,544 --> 01:19:47,392
Why can't we get past this?

1366
01:19:47,463 --> 01:19:49,866
I mean, are we gonna carry this thing
around forever?

1367
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:54,065
- Forever? It just happened.
- It happened three weeks ago.

1368
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:57,457
You know how a year to a person
is like seven years to a dog?

1369
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:00,396
Yes.

1370
01:20:02,603 --> 01:20:05,715
Is one of us supposed
to be a dog in this scenario?

1371
01:20:05,903 --> 01:20:08,437
- Yes.
- Who is the dog?

1372
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:10,479
- You are.
- I am?

1373
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:11,699
- I am the dog?
- Mm hmm.

1374
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:13,882
I am the dog?
I ...

1375
01:20:20,396 --> 01:20:23,372
I don't see that, Harry.
If anybody is the dog, you are the dog.

1376
01:20:23,404 --> 01:20:25,484
You wanna act like what happened
didn't mean anything.

1377
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:26,953
I'm not saying it didn't
mean anything.

1378
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:28,819
I'm saying, why does it have
to mean everything?

1379
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:32,038
Because it does. And you should
know that better than anybody,

1380
01:20:32,072 --> 01:20:34,370
because the minute that it happened,
you walked right out the door.

1381
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:37,256
- I didn't walk out.
- No. Sprinted is more like it.

1382
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:41,002
- We both agreed it was a mistake.
- The worst mistake I ever made.

1383
01:20:42,774 --> 01:20:45,022
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want anything from you!

1384
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,048
Fine! Fine. But let's get
one thing straight.

1385
01:20:47,102 --> 01:20:49,159
I did not go over there that night
to make love to you.

1386
01:20:49,229 --> 01:20:50,775
That is not why I went there.

1387
01:20:50,857 --> 01:20:53,860
But you looked up at me with these big,
weepy eyes. "Don't go home tonight, Harry.

1388
01:20:53,908 --> 01:20:56,457
Hold me a little longer, Harry."
What was I supposed to do?

1389
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,072
What are you saying?
You took pity on me?

1390
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:01,229
- No, I was...
- Fuck you!

1391
01:21:05,137 --> 01:21:08,259
Hey, everybody, could I have
your attention, please?

1392
01:21:08,379 --> 01:21:12,622
I'd like to propose a toast
to Harry and Sally.

1393
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:14,624
To Harry and Sally.

1394
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,272
If Marie or I had found either of them
remotely attractive,

1395
01:21:19,345 --> 01:21:21,279
we would not be here today.

1396
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:36,432
♪ Have yourself a merry little
Christmas

1397
01:21:37,236 --> 01:21:39,968
♪ Let yourself be light

1398
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:47,401
♪ From now on
our troubles will be out of sight

1399
01:21:51,888 --> 01:21:56,205
♪ Have yourself a merry little
Christmas

1400
01:21:57,168 --> 01:22:00,382
♪ Make the yuletide gay

1401
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:07,746
♪ From now on
our troubles will be miles away

1402
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:10,520
Hi. It's me.

1403
01:22:10,694 --> 01:22:12,957
It's the holiday season
and I thought I'd remind you

1404
01:22:12,997 --> 01:22:15,416
that this is the season
of charity and forgiveness.

1405
01:22:15,573 --> 01:22:17,723
And, although
it is not widely known,

1406
01:22:17,793 --> 01:22:20,091
it is also the season
of groveling.

1407
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,982
So if you felt
like calling me back,

1408
01:22:23,044 --> 01:22:27,078
I'd be more than happy to do
the traditional Christmas grovel.

1409
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,395
Give me a call.

1410
01:22:45,138 --> 01:22:47,995
Hi. I'm not home right now.
I'll call you right back.

1411
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,125
If you're there, pick up the phone.
I really wanna talk to you.

1412
01:22:54,823 --> 01:22:57,615
The fact that you're not answering
leads me to believe you're either,

1413
01:22:57,678 --> 01:22:59,433
A, not at home,

1414
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:02,021
B, home,
but don't wanna talk to me,

1415
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:07,191
or C, home, desperately wanna talk to
me, but trapped under something heavy.

1416
01:23:07,705 --> 01:23:10,435
If it's either A or C,
please call me back.

1417
01:23:13,105 --> 01:23:14,831
Obviously, she doesn't
wanna talk to me.

1418
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:17,157
What do I have to do,
be hit over the head?

1419
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:18,949
She wants to call me,
she'll call me.

1420
01:23:19,371 --> 01:23:21,182
I am through
making a schmuck out of myself.

1421
01:23:21,651 --> 01:23:25,049
If you're feeling
sad and lonely

1422
01:23:25,161 --> 01:23:28,310
There's a service
I can render

1423
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:31,422
Tell the one
who digs you only

1424
01:23:31,518 --> 01:23:34,899
I can be so warm and tender

1425
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:36,329
Call me

1426
01:23:36,598 --> 01:23:40,142
Maybe it's late
to just call me

1427
01:23:40,275 --> 01:23:43,921
Don't be afraid
to just phone moi.

1428
01:23:44,017 --> 01:23:47,841
Call me and I'll be around

1429
01:23:48,187 --> 01:23:50,441
- Give me a call.
- Hi, Harry.

1430
01:23:50,602 --> 01:23:54,922
Hello. Hi.
I didn't know that you were there.

1431
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:57,857
- What are you doing?
- I was just on my way out.

1432
01:23:58,178 --> 01:23:59,794
Where are you going?

1433
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:03,458
- What do you want, Harry?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1434
01:24:03,532 --> 01:24:06,899
I just called to say I'm sorry.

1435
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:10,065
Okay.

1436
01:24:17,527 --> 01:24:18,703
I gotta go.

1437
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:20,855
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

1438
01:24:21,316 --> 01:24:22,508
What are you doing
for New Year's?

1439
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,073
Are you going to
the Tylers' party?

1440
01:24:24,099 --> 01:24:26,613
'Cause I don't have a date.
And if you don't have a date,

1441
01:24:26,663 --> 01:24:28,973
we always said that if
neither one of us had a date,

1442
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:31,865
we could be together
for New Year's and ....

1443
01:24:31,976 --> 01:24:35,571
I can't do this anymore.
I am not your consolation prize.

1444
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:36,749
Goodbye.

1445
01:24:46,645 --> 01:24:48,775
And here we are,
once again,

1446
01:24:48,844 --> 01:24:51,966
the 16th annual
New Year's Rockin' Eve,

1447
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,076
coming to you live from the ...

1448
01:24:54,246 --> 01:24:55,675
What's so bad about this?

1449
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:57,742
You got Dick Clark.
That's tradition.

1450
01:24:57,893 --> 01:25:00,507
You got Malomars,
the greatest cookie of all time.

1451
01:25:00,675 --> 01:25:05,188
And you're about to give the Knicks
their first championship since 1973.

1452
01:25:23,211 --> 01:25:25,736
I don't know
why I let you drag me to this.

1453
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:34,480
This is much better. Fresh air.
I've the streets all to myself.

1454
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:38,424
Who needs to be at a big crowded party
pretending to have a good time?

1455
01:25:38,672 --> 01:25:42,293
Plus this is the perfect time
to catch up on my window shopping.

1456
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:44,631
This is good.

1457
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:58,895
So the guy says,
"Read the card."

1458
01:26:09,043 --> 01:26:11,671
- I'm going home.
- You'll never get a taxi.

1459
01:26:13,308 --> 01:26:14,366
Oh, God!

1460
01:26:42,157 --> 01:26:44,549
You realize, of course,
that we could never be friends.

1461
01:26:44,826 --> 01:26:46,057
Why not?

1462
01:26:46,142 --> 01:26:48,851
What I'm saying, is that
men and women can't be friends,

1463
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:51,006
because the sex part
always gets in the way.

1464
01:26:51,348 --> 01:26:52,566
That's not true.

1465
01:26:52,634 --> 01:26:55,068
No man can be friends
with a woman he finds attractive.

1466
01:26:55,246 --> 01:26:57,071
He always wants
to have sex with her.

1467
01:26:57,422 --> 01:26:59,455
What if they don't wanna
have sex with you?

1468
01:26:59,519 --> 01:27:01,808
Doesn't matter, because
the sex thing is already out there,

1469
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:05,556
so the friendship is ultimately doomed,
and that is the end of the story.

1470
01:27:06,004 --> 01:27:08,130
Well, I guess we're not
gonna be friends then.

1471
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:09,073
Guess not.

1472
01:27:09,106 --> 01:27:10,752
It's too bad,

1473
01:27:10,778 --> 01:27:14,008
'cause you were the only person
that I knew in New York.

1474
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:22,405
♪ It had to be you

1475
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:30,449
♪ It had to be you

1476
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:36,912
♪ I wandered around

1477
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:40,805
♪ And I finally found

1478
01:27:41,296 --> 01:27:44,320
♪ The somebody who

1479
01:27:48,392 --> 01:27:53,632
♪ Could make me be true

1480
01:27:54,648 --> 01:27:59,995
♪ And could make me be blue

1481
01:28:00,535 --> 01:28:02,018
I'm going.

1482
01:28:02,303 --> 01:28:03,620
It's almost midnight.

1483
01:28:04,188 --> 01:28:08,249
- Well, the thought of not kissing somebody is just...
- I'll kiss you.

1484
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,003
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

1485
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:18,499
Come on. Stay. Please.

1486
01:28:18,763 --> 01:28:20,802
Thanks, Jess.
I'll just... I have to go.

1487
01:28:20,914 --> 01:28:23,582
- Oh, wait two minutes.

1489
01:28:31,331 --> 01:28:34,769
♪ Might never be cross

1490
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:38,359
♪ Or try to be boss

1492

♪ It had to be you...

1497
01:29:03,527 --> 01:29:07,077
I've been doing a lot of thinking,
and the thing is, I love you.

1498
01:29:07,732 --> 01:29:09,911
- What?
- I love you.

1499
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:13,246
How do you expect me
to respond to this?

1500
01:29:13,457 --> 01:29:15,418
How about you love me too?

1501
01:29:15,712 --> 01:29:17,292
How about "I'm leaving"?

1502
01:29:17,381 --> 01:29:19,589
Doesn't what I said
mean anything to you?

1503
01:29:19,746 --> 01:29:22,574
I'm sorry, Harry.
I know it's New Year's Eve.

1504
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:25,835
I know you're feeling lonely,
but you just can't show up here,

1505
01:29:25,923 --> 01:29:28,907
tell me you love me and expect that
to make everything all right.

1506
01:29:29,051 --> 01:29:31,013
- Three, two, one!
- It doesn't work this way.

1507
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:32,569
Well, how does it work?

1508
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,153
I don't know,
but not this way.

1509
01:29:35,447 --> 01:29:36,851
How about this way?

1510
01:29:36,962 --> 01:29:39,590
I love that you get cold
when it's 71 degrees out.

1511
01:29:39,737 --> 01:29:42,365
I love that it takes you
an hour and a half to order a sandwich.

1512
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,416
I love that you get a little crinkle
above your nose

1513
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:45,938
when you're looking at me
like I'm nuts.

1514
01:29:46,004 --> 01:29:49,838
I love after I spend the day with you,
I can still smell your perfume on my clothes.

1515
01:29:49,941 --> 01:29:54,643
And I love that you are the last person
I wanna talk to before I go to sleep at night.

1516
01:29:54,785 --> 01:29:58,563
And it's not because I'm lonely, and
it's not because it's New Year's Eve.

1517
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,687
I came here tonight,
because when you realize

1518
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:02,948
you wanna spend
the rest of your life with somebody,

1519
01:30:03,012 --> 01:30:06,560
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

1520
01:30:10,033 --> 01:30:11,466
You see?

1521
01:30:12,531 --> 01:30:14,687
That is just like you, Harry.

1522
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:19,381
You say things like that and you make
it impossible for me to hate you.

1523
01:30:20,241 --> 01:30:23,074
And I hate you, Harry.

1524
01:30:24,181 --> 01:30:26,615
I really hate you.

1525
01:30:30,268 --> 01:30:31,929
I hate you.

1526
01:30:38,829 --> 01:30:45,646
We'll take a cup
of kindness yet

1527
01:30:45,822 --> 01:30:49,553
For auld lang syne

1528
01:30:49,579 --> 01:30:52,923
What does this song mean? My whole life
I don't know what this song means.

1529
01:30:52,969 --> 01:30:55,071
I mean, "Should old acquaintance
be forgot."

1530
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:56,902
Does that mean that
we should forget old acquaintances,

1531
01:30:56,957 --> 01:30:59,252
or does it mean if we happen to
forget them, we should remember them,

1532
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:01,601
which is not possible
because we already forgot 'em.

1533
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:06,588
Well, maybe it just means that we should
remember that we forgot them, or something.

1534
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:12,147
Anyway,
it's about old friends.

1535
01:31:14,346 --> 01:31:19,040
In days of auld lang syne

1536
01:31:19,115 --> 01:31:21,304
The first time we met,
we hated each other.

1537
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:24,029
No, you didn't hate me.
I hated you.

1538
01:31:24,274 --> 01:31:26,574
The second time we met,
you didn't even remember me.

1539
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,834
I did too.
I remembered you.

1540
01:31:29,079 --> 01:31:31,596
The third time we met,
we became friends.

1541
01:31:31,676 --> 01:31:35,156
- We were friends for a long time.
- And then we weren't.

1542
01:31:35,337 --> 01:31:37,492
And then we fell in love.

1543
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:41,179
- Three months later, we got married.
- And it only took three months.

1544
01:31:41,826 --> 01:31:45,728
- Twelve years and three months.
- We had this really wonderful wedding.

1545
01:31:45,884 --> 01:31:48,284
- It really was a beautiful wedding.
- It was great.

1546
01:31:48,397 --> 01:31:50,272
We had
this enormous coconut cake.

1547
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:52,832
A huge coconut cake
with the tiers

1548
01:31:52,903 --> 01:31:55,971
and there was this
very rich chocolate sauce on the side.

1549
01:31:56,018 --> 01:31:59,640
Right. 'Cause not everybody likes it on
the cake 'cause it makes it very soggy.

1550
01:31:59,726 --> 01:32:02,362
Particularly the coconut,
soaks up a lot of that sauce, you really...

1551
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:04,582
- it's important to keep it on the side.
- Right.
